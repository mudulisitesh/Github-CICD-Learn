Okay, here's a randomly generated DSA problem and a corresponding Python solution:

**Problem: Anagram Grouping**

Given a list of strings, group the anagrams together. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example:**

Input: `["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]`
Output:
```
[
  ["eat","tea","ate"],
  ["tan","nat"],
  ["bat"]
]
```

**Explanation:**

*   "eat", "tea", and "ate" are anagrams of each other.
*   "tan" and "nat" are anagrams of each other.
*   "bat" has no anagrams in the input list.

**Python Solution:**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def group_anagrams(strs):
    """
    Groups anagrams from a list of strings.

    Args:
        strs: A list of strings.

    Returns:
        A list of lists, where each inner list contains a group of anagrams.
    """

    anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)  # Dictionary to store anagrams based on sorted representation
    for s in strs:
        sorted_s = "".join(sorted(s))  # Sort the string to create a unique key for anagrams
        anagram_groups[sorted_s].append(s)  # Append the original string to the group corresponding to the sorted key

    return list(anagram_groups.values())  # Return the values (lists of anagrams)

# Example usage
input_strings = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
result = group_anagrams(input_strings)
print(result)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`defaultdict(list)`:**  We use `defaultdict` from the `collections` module.  This is a dictionary that automatically creates a default value (in this case, an empty list) when a key is accessed that doesn't exist.  This simplifies the grouping process.

2.  **Iteration:** We iterate through each string `s` in the input list `strs`.

3.  **Sorting for Anagram Identification:**  The core idea is that anagrams have the same letters, just in different orders.  We sort the characters in each string `s` to create a unique "fingerprint" for all its anagrams. `sorted(s)` returns a list of characters in sorted order.  `"".join(...)` joins the sorted characters back into a string.

4.  **Grouping:**
    *   `anagram_groups[sorted_s].append(s)`: We use the sorted string `sorted_s` as the key in the `anagram_groups` dictionary.  We append the *original* string `s` to the list associated with that key.  This groups together all strings that have the same sorted representation (i.e., are anagrams).

5.  **Returning the Result:**
    *   `list(anagram_groups.values())`:  Finally, we return a list containing all the values (which are the lists of anagrams) from the `anagram_groups` dictionary.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K log K), where N is the number of strings in the input list and K is the maximum length of a string.  We iterate through each string (O(N)), and for each string, we sort it (O(K log K)).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N * K), where N is the number of strings and K is the maximum length of a string.  In the worst case, we might store all the strings in the `anagram_groups` dictionary.
