Okay, here's a problem and its Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Group Anagrams**

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example:**

```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

**Explanation:**

*   "eat", "tea", and "ate" are anagrams of each other.
*   "tan" and "nat" are anagrams of each other.
*   "bat" has no anagrams in the input.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= strs.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
*   0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
*   strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

**Python Code Solution:**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def group_anagrams(strs):
    """
    Groups anagrams together from a list of strings.

    Args:
      strs: A list of strings.

    Returns:
      A list of lists, where each inner list contains anagrams.
    """

    anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)  # Use defaultdict for easier grouping

    for s in strs:
        # Sort the string to create a unique key for each anagram group
        sorted_s = "".join(sorted(s))  # Sort and convert back to string
        anagram_groups[sorted_s].append(s)

    return list(anagram_groups.values())  # Return the list of groups


# Example usage:
strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
result = group_anagrams(strs)
print(result) # Output: [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']] (or a similar order)

strs = [""]
result = group_anagrams(strs)
print(result) #Output: [['']]

strs = ["a"]
result = group_anagrams(strs)
print(result) #Output: [['a']]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`group_anagrams(strs)` Function:**
    *   `anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)`:  A `defaultdict` is used to store the anagram groups.  The keys will be sorted strings (the "signature" of the anagram), and the values will be lists of strings that are anagrams.  `defaultdict(list)` means that if you try to access a key that doesn't exist, it will automatically create an empty list for that key.  This avoids `KeyError` exceptions and simplifies the logic.
    *   The code iterates through each string `s` in the input `strs`.
    *   `sorted_s = "".join(sorted(s))`:  This is the core of the solution.  For each string `s`, it sorts the characters alphabetically using `sorted(s)` which returns a list of characters.  Then, `"".join()` concatenates the characters back into a single string.  This sorted string serves as a unique identifier for all anagrams of `s`. For example, "eat", "tea", and "ate" will all become "aet" after this sorting process.
    *   `anagram_groups[sorted_s].append(s)`:  The sorted string `sorted_s` is used as the key to access the `anagram_groups` dictionary. The original string `s` is appended to the list associated with that key.
    *   `return list(anagram_groups.values())`:  Finally, the function returns a list containing all the lists of anagrams. `anagram_groups.values()` returns a collection of the lists, and `list()` converts it into a standard list.

2.  **Time and Space Complexity:**

    *   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K * log K), where N is the number of strings in the input array and K is the average length of the strings.  The `sorted(s)` operation takes O(K * log K) time for each string.  We perform this sorting N times. The other operations are O(1).
    *   **Space Complexity:** O(N * K), where N is the number of strings and K is the maximum length of a string. In the worst case, all the strings are unique and each string will be stored in `anagram_groups`.
**How it works:**

The fundamental idea is that anagrams have the same characters, just in different orders. By sorting the characters of each string, we create a "signature" or canonical form for each anagram group. This signature is then used as a key in the dictionary to group the anagrams together. The `defaultdict` simplifies the code by automatically creating a new list for each new signature encountered.
