Okay, here's a problem and a corresponding Python solution.

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation:
The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == lists.length`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq  # For min-heap

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of ListNode objects, each representing the head of a sorted linked list.

    Returns:
        The head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    heap = []

    # Push the first node of each list into the heap
    for i in range(len(lists)):
      if lists[i]: # important check in case some lists are empty
        heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i, lists[i]))  # (value, index, node)

    dummy = ListNode(0) # Dummy node to simplify the merging process
    tail = dummy

    while heap:
        val, index, node = heapq.heappop(heap) # Pop the smallest node

        tail.next = node
        tail = tail.next

        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, index, node.next))  # Push the next node from the same list
    return dummy.next

# Example Usage (creating and printing linked lists)
def create_linked_list(arr):
    if not arr:
        return None
    head = ListNode(arr[0])
    curr = head
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        curr.next = ListNode(arr[i])
        curr = curr.next
    return head

def print_linked_list(head):
    result = []
    while head:
        result.append(str(head.val))
        head = head.next
    return "->".join(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example Input
    lists_data = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
    lists = []
    for arr in lists_data:
        lists.append(create_linked_list(arr))
    # Merge the lists
    merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

    # Print the merged list
    print(print_linked_list(merged_list))  # Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

Key improvements and explanations:

*   **`ListNode` Class:**  The code includes a `ListNode` class definition, which is essential for working with linked lists.
*   **Heap-based Solution:** The solution uses a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently find the smallest node among all the `k` lists at each step.  `heapq` is Python's built-in min-heap implementation.
*   **Tuple in Heap:**  The heap stores tuples of the form `(node.val, index, node)`.  This is critical.
    *   `node.val`:  The value of the node, used for comparison in the heap.
    *   `index`: The *index* of the list the node came from in the original `lists` array. This is vital for preventing issues if multiple nodes have the same value. Without the index, the heap's comparison might break.
    *   `node`: The actual `ListNode` object itself.
*   **Dummy Node:**  A dummy node (`dummy = ListNode(0)`) is used to simplify the construction of the merged list.  It avoids special-casing the first node.  `tail` keeps track of the end of the merged list as we build it.
*   **Heap Operations:**
    *   `heapq.heappush(heap, (node.val, index, node))`: Adds a new node to the heap.
    *   `heapq.heappop(heap)`: Removes the node with the smallest value from the heap.
*   **Correct Heap Ordering:** The heap is ordered correctly by the *value* of the nodes, ensuring the smallest node is always at the top.
*   **Handles Empty Lists:** The code now handles cases where the input `lists` array contains empty lists (`lists[i]` is `None`). This is a very important check because it prevents errors.
*   **Clearer Comments and Docstrings:**  Improved comments explain each step of the algorithm.
*   **Complete Example:** The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block provides a complete, runnable example, including creating the initial linked lists and printing the merged list. This is invaluable for testing and understanding the code.  `create_linked_list` and `print_linked_list` make the example fully self-contained.
*   **`index` for Heap Tiebreaker:**  The tuple `(lists[i].val, i, lists[i])` is used in the heap.  The `i` (list index) acts as a tie-breaker if two nodes have the same `val`.  This prevents errors that could occur with simple value-based comparisons.
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all linked lists and k is the number of linked lists.  The heap operations (push and pop) take O(log k) time each, and we perform these operations N times.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(k).  The heap stores at most k nodes (one from each list). O(1) additional space is used.
This comprehensive solution addresses all the requirements of the problem and is well-documented for clarity.  The `ListNode` class, the dummy node, and the heap-based approach are all standard techniques for solving linked list and merging problems.  The example usage makes it easy to run and test the code.
