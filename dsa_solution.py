Okay, here's a DSA problem and its Python solution, along with an explanation:

**Problem: Group Anagrams**

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example:**

```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

**Explanation:**

*   "eat", "tea", and "ate" are anagrams of each other.
*   "tan" and "nat" are anagrams of each other.
*   "bat" is not an anagram of any other string in the list.

**Solution (Python):**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs):
    """
    Groups anagrams together in a list of strings.

    Args:
      strs: A list of strings.

    Returns:
      A list of lists, where each inner list contains anagrams.
    """

    anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)  # Dictionary to store anagrams, key is sorted string

    for s in strs:
        sorted_s = "".join(sorted(s))  # Sort the string to use as a key
        anagram_groups[sorted_s].append(s)

    return list(anagram_groups.values())  # Return the values (lists of anagrams)


# Example Usage:
strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
result = groupAnagrams(strs)
print(result)  # Output: [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']] (or any other order)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`defaultdict(list)`:** We use a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module.  This is like a regular dictionary, but if you try to access a key that doesn't exist, it automatically creates that key with a default value (in this case, an empty list).  This is perfect for grouping.

2.  **Iterate through Strings:** The code iterates through each string `s` in the input list `strs`.

3.  **Sort and Create Key:** The core idea is to sort each string. Anagrams, by definition, have the same characters but in a different order. When you sort them, they become identical.
    *   `sorted(s)` returns a list of the characters in `s` sorted alphabetically.
    *   `"".join(...)` joins these characters back into a string.  This sorted string is now our key.

4.  **Group Anagrams:**
    *   `anagram_groups[sorted_s].append(s)`:  We use the sorted string `sorted_s` as the key in our `anagram_groups` dictionary. We then append the original string `s` to the list associated with that key.  If the key doesn't exist yet, `defaultdict` creates it with an empty list, and then `s` is added.

5.  **Return Values:**
    *   `list(anagram_groups.values())`:  Finally, we return the values of the `anagram_groups` dictionary. The values are the lists containing the grouped anagrams. `list()` converts the dictionary's "view" of values into a standard list.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K log K), where N is the number of strings in the input and K is the maximum length of a string.  We iterate through each string (N), and for each string, we sort it (K log K).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N * K), where N is the number of strings and K is the maximum length of a string.  In the worst case, we might store all the strings in the `anagram_groups` dictionary.

**Why this approach is good:**

*   **Efficiency:** Using the sorted string as a key is a very efficient way to identify anagrams.
*   **Clarity:** The code is relatively easy to understand and follow.
*   **Use of `defaultdict`:**  `defaultdict` makes the code cleaner by automatically handling the creation of new lists for each anagram group.

This solution is a common and efficient way to solve the Group Anagrams problem.  It's a good example of how to use a hash table (in this case, a dictionary) to group elements based on a property (being an anagram).
