Okay, here's a DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == lists.length`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other):  # Needed for heapq to compare ListNode objects
        return self.val < other.val

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of linked lists, where each linked list is sorted in ascending order.

    Returns:
        The head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    heap = []

    # Push the head of each linked list into the heap
    for i in range(len(lists)):
      if lists[i]:
        heapq.heappush(heap, lists[i])

    dummy = ListNode()  # Dummy node for the merged list
    tail = dummy

    while heap:
        node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        tail.next = node
        tail = tail.next

        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, node.next)

    return dummy.next


# Example Usage:
# Create the linked lists for the example input
list1 = ListNode(1, ListNode(4, ListNode(5)))
list2 = ListNode(1, ListNode(3, ListNode(4)))
list3 = ListNode(2, ListNode(6))

lists = [list1, list2, list3]

# Merge the lists
merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

# Print the merged list (for verification)
while merged_list:
    print(merged_list.val, end=" -> ")
    merged_list = merged_list.next
print("None")  # Output: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> None
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ListNode` Class:** Defines the structure of a node in the linked list, including a value (`val`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`). The `__lt__` method is important; it allows the `heapq` module to directly compare `ListNode` objects based on their `val` attribute.  Without it, the heap wouldn't know how to prioritize the nodes.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `heap`: A min-heap (priority queue) is used to efficiently find the smallest element among all the lists' heads.  It stores `ListNode` objects.
        *   `dummy`: A dummy node is created as the starting point of the merged list.  This simplifies the logic for adding the first node to the merged list.
        *   `tail`:  A pointer to the last node in the merged list, initialized to the dummy node.
    *   **Adding Initial Heads to Heap:** The code iterates through the input `lists` and pushes the head node of each non-empty list onto the min-heap. The `heapq.heappush` function maintains the heap property, ensuring that the smallest element is always at the top.
    *   **Merging Process:**
        *   The `while heap:` loop continues as long as the heap is not empty.
        *   `heapq.heappop(heap)`: The smallest node (head node) is extracted from the heap. This node is the next element to be added to the merged list.
        *   `tail.next = node`:  The extracted node is appended to the end of the merged list.  `tail` is updated to point to the newly added node.
        *   `if node.next:`: If the extracted node has a `next` node in its original list, that `next` node is pushed onto the heap, so it can be considered for merging in the future.
    *   **Return Result:** Finally, the function returns `dummy.next`, which is the head of the merged sorted linked list (skipping the dummy node).

**Why use a Heap?**

The key to solving this problem efficiently is using a min-heap (priority queue). Here's why:

*   **Finding the Minimum:**  You need to repeatedly find the smallest element among the heads of the `k` lists. A min-heap allows you to find the minimum element in O(1) time (it's always at the top of the heap) and extract it in O(log k) time (because the heap needs to be re-organized after extraction).
*   **Efficiency:**  A naive approach of repeatedly scanning the `k` lists to find the minimum would take O(k) time for each element, leading to a much slower overall time complexity.
*   **Time Complexity:**  The time complexity of the heap-based solution is O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all the linked lists and k is the number of linked lists. This is because each of the N nodes is inserted into and extracted from the heap once, and each heap operation takes O(log k) time.

This solution is generally considered the most efficient way to solve the "Merge K Sorted Lists" problem.
