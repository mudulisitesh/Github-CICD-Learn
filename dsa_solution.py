Okay, here's a randomly generated DSA problem and a Python solution.

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == len(lists)`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other): #For heapq comparison
        return self.val < other.val

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of linked lists, where each linked list is sorted in ascending order.

    Returns:
        The head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    heap = []  # Min-heap to store the head nodes of the lists.

    # Add the head nodes of all non-empty lists to the heap.
    for head in lists:
        if head:
            heapq.heappush(heap, head)

    dummy = ListNode()  # Dummy node to simplify the creation of the merged list.
    tail = dummy       # Tail pointer to append nodes to the merged list.

    while heap:
        # Get the node with the smallest value from the heap.
        node = heapq.heappop(heap)

        # Append the node to the merged list.
        tail.next = node
        tail = tail.next

        # If the node has a next node, add it to the heap.
        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, node.next)

    return dummy.next
#Example Usage:
# Helper function to create a linked list from a list of values
def create_linked_list(values):
    if not values:
        return None

    head = ListNode(values[0])
    current = head
    for val in values[1:]:
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
    return head

# Helper function to print a linked list
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.val, end=" -> ")
        current = current.next
    print("None")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example Usage
    list1 = create_linked_list([1, 4, 5])
    list2 = create_linked_list([1, 3, 4])
    list3 = create_linked_list([2, 6])

    lists = [list1, list2, list3]

    merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

    print("Merged List:")
    print_linked_list(merged_list)  # Output: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> None
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **ListNode Class:** Defines the structure of a node in a singly-linked list. Includes a `__lt__` method to enable comparison between `ListNode` objects for the priority queue.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   Creates a min-heap `heap` using `heapq` from the `heapq` library.  The `heapq` module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm.
        *   Creates a `dummy` node to serve as a starting point for building the merged list. `tail` points to the last node added to the merged list so far.
    *   **Heap Initialization:**
        *   Iterates through the `lists` (the array of linked lists).
        *   If a list is not empty (its head is not `None`), it pushes the head node onto the `heap`.  The heap will automatically maintain the smallest node at the top.
    *   **Merging:**
        *   Enters a `while` loop that continues as long as the `heap` is not empty.
        *   `heapq.heappop(heap)`: Retrieves and removes the smallest node (the node with the smallest value) from the `heap`.
        *   `tail.next = node`: Appends the retrieved node to the end of the merged list (pointed to by `tail`).
        *   `tail = tail.next`: Advances the `tail` pointer to the newly added node.
        *   `if node.next:`: If the retrieved node has a next node in its original list, that next node is pushed onto the `heap` to be considered for merging.
    *   **Return:**
        *   `return dummy.next`:  Returns the `next` node of the `dummy` node, which is the head of the merged sorted linked list.

3. **Helper Functions:**
    *   `create_linked_list()` creates a linked list from a standard Python list.  This is used to set up the problem.
    *   `print_linked_list()` prints the linked list in a readable format. This is for verification purposes.

4.  **Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes across all k lists, and k is the number of lists.  Each node is added to and removed from the heap once. The heap operations (push and pop) take O(log k) time.

5.  **Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of linked lists.  This is the space used by the min-heap. In the worst case, the heap might contain one node from each list. Also, the space used to create the merged list is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes.  If we don't count the output list, then the space complexity is O(k).
**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

*   **Heap (Priority Queue):** Using a min-heap (priority queue) is the most efficient way to find the smallest node among the heads of the `k` lists at any given time.
*   **ListNode Class:** The `ListNode` class makes the code more readable and structured when dealing with linked lists.
*   **Dummy Node:** The `dummy` node simplifies the logic for building the merged linked list, especially when handling the case where the merged list starts empty.
*   **Clarity and Comments:** The code includes detailed comments to explain the purpose of each part.
*   **Example Usage:** The `if __name__ == '__main__'` block provides a clear example of how to use the `mergeKLists` function.  The helper functions make the testing process much easier.
*   **Handles Empty Lists:** The code correctly handles cases where some of the input lists are empty.

This comprehensive solution should be easy to understand and implement.  It uses the best data structure (min-heap) for the job and provides clear explanations.
