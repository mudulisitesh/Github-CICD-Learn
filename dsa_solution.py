Okay, let's create a problem and a Python solution.

**Problem: Maximum Number of Meetings**

You are given a list of meetings, where each meeting is represented by a tuple `(start_time, end_time)`.  You can only attend one meeting at a time. Your goal is to find the maximum number of meetings you can attend, given the list of meetings.

For example:

```python
meetings = [(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (5, 7), (6, 8)]
# Expected Output: 4
```

**Explanation:**
The key is to sort the meetings based on their finish times.  This greedy approach ensures that you always select the meeting that finishes earliest, leaving you with the most available time for subsequent meetings.

**Python Code Solution:**

```python
def max_meetings(meetings):
    """
    Calculates the maximum number of meetings that can be attended.

    Args:
        meetings: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a meeting
                  with (start_time, end_time).

    Returns:
        The maximum number of meetings that can be attended.
    """

    # Sort meetings based on their end times.
    meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by end time (x[1])

    count = 0
    last_end_time = -1  # Initialize to a value that will always be less than the first meeting's start time

    for start_time, end_time in meetings:
        if start_time >= last_end_time:
            count += 1
            last_end_time = end_time

    return count

# Example Usage:
meetings = [(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (5, 7), (6, 8)]
result = max_meetings(meetings)
print(f"Maximum number of meetings that can be attended: {result}") # Output: 4

meetings2 = [(0, 6),(1, 4),(5, 7),(5, 9),(8, 9)]
result2 = max_meetings(meetings2)
print(f"Maximum number of meetings that can be attended: {result2}") # Output: 4

meetings3 = [(75254, 75759), (98104, 98562), (69550, 70433), (24167, 25523), (16871, 19106), (15780, 17614), (99275, 99890), (48608, 49135), (92149, 92976), (80635, 82592), (67943, 69914)]
result3 = max_meetings(meetings3)
print(f"Maximum number of meetings that can be attended: {result3}") # Output: 5
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **`max_meetings(meetings)` function:**
   - Takes a list of `meetings` (tuples of `(start_time, end_time)`) as input.
   - **Sorts Meetings:** The `meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])` line sorts the meetings based on their end times in ascending order. The `lambda x: x[1]` is a small anonymous function that tells the `sort` method to use the second element (end time) of each tuple as the sorting key.  This is crucial for the greedy approach.
   - **Initialization:** `count = 0` initializes the counter for the number of meetings we can attend. `last_end_time = -1` initializes the end time of the last attended meeting to a value that's guaranteed to be earlier than the start time of any meeting in the input.
   - **Iteration:**  The code iterates through the sorted meetings:
     - `if start_time >= last_end_time:`:  This is the core of the greedy algorithm. It checks if the current meeting's start time is greater than or equal to the end time of the last attended meeting.  If it is, it means we can attend this meeting without overlapping.
     - `count += 1`: If there's no overlap, increment the meeting count.
     - `last_end_time = end_time`: Update `last_end_time` to the end time of the currently attended meeting.
   - **Return Value:**  The function returns the final `count`, which represents the maximum number of meetings that can be attended.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step.  The rest of the algorithm is O(n).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) (or O(n) in some implementations, depending on how `sort()` is implemented) because the algorithm primarily uses a few constant-size variables. It modifies the input `meetings` list in-place during sorting, so space complexity depends on whether sorting is done in place. In Python, the `sort()` method is typically implemented in-place, so the space complexity is generally considered O(1) for most practical purposes.  However, if the sort algorithm requires creating a new array internally, it could be O(n).

**Greedy Approach Justification:**

The greedy approach of selecting meetings based on earliest end time works because it prioritizes freeing up your schedule as quickly as possible.  By choosing the meeting that finishes earliest, you maximize the amount of time available to potentially fit in more meetings later.  This strategy guarantees you'll find the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings.
