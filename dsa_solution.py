Okay, here's a randomly generated DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Meeting Room Availability**

You are given a list of meeting time intervals where each interval consists of a start time and an end time: `intervals = [[start1, end1], [start2, end2], ...]`.  Determine if a person could attend all meetings.  In other words, check if there are any overlapping meeting intervals.

**Example:**

*   `intervals = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]`  ->  `False` (Meetings overlap: [0, 30] overlaps with [5, 10])
*   `intervals = [[7, 10], [2, 4]]`  ->  `True` (No overlaps)

**Constraints:**

*   The input `intervals` is a list of lists (2D array).
*   Each inner list represents an interval and has two integers: start time and end time.
*   `start` and `end` are non-negative integers.
*   `start < end` (for any given interval).

**Solution (Python):**

```python
def can_attend_all_meetings(intervals):
    """
    Checks if a person can attend all meetings without any overlaps.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of meeting time intervals, where each interval is a list [start, end].

    Returns:
        True if the person can attend all meetings, False otherwise.
    """

    # Sort the intervals by their start times.  This is a crucial step.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda interval: interval[0])

    # Iterate through the sorted intervals, checking for overlaps.
    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]:
            # Overlap detected: The current meeting starts before the previous meeting ends.
            return False

    # No overlaps found.
    return True

# Example usage:
intervals1 = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
print(f"Intervals: {intervals1}, Can attend all meetings: {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals1)}")  # Output: False

intervals2 = [[7, 10], [2, 4]]
print(f"Intervals: {intervals2}, Can attend all meetings: {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals2)}")  # Output: True

intervals3 = [[1,3],[6,7],[4,5]]
print(f"Intervals: {intervals3}, Can attend all meetings: {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals3)}") # Output: True

intervals4 = [[13,15],[1,13]]
print(f"Intervals: {intervals4}, Can attend all meetings: {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals4)}") # Output: False
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Sorting:** The key idea is to sort the intervals by their start times.  This allows us to efficiently check for overlaps by comparing consecutive intervals. If intervals are not sorted, you'd have to compare every interval with every other interval, leading to a less efficient O(n^2) solution.

2.  **Overlap Detection:**  After sorting, we iterate through the intervals and check if the start time of the current interval is less than the end time of the previous interval.  If it is, it means the two intervals overlap, and we return `False`.

3.  **No Overlaps:** If the loop completes without finding any overlaps, it means the person can attend all meetings, and we return `True`.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n log n) due to the sorting step.  The rest of the algorithm is O(n).

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(1) (or O(n) depending on the sorting algorithm implementation used by Python's `sort()` which in most cases, does in-place sorting and takes O(log n) space but could take O(n) in the worst case).  We are not using any significant extra space.
