Okay, here's a DSA problem and a corresponding Python solution.

**Problem:**

**Group Anagrams**

Given a list of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together.  You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example:**

```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
*   `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

**Python Solution:**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def group_anagrams(strs):
    """
    Groups anagrams in a list of strings together.

    Args:
        strs: A list of strings.

    Returns:
        A list of lists, where each inner list contains anagrams.
    """
    anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)  # Use defaultdict to avoid key errors

    for s in strs:
        # Sort the characters in the string to create a unique key for anagrams
        sorted_s = "".join(sorted(s))
        anagram_groups[sorted_s].append(s)

    return list(anagram_groups.values())  # Return the values (lists of anagrams)


# Example usage:
strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
result = group_anagrams(strs)
print(result)  # Output: [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']] (order may vary)

strs2 = [""]
result2 = group_anagrams(strs2)
print(result2)  # Output: [['']]

strs3 = ["a"]
result3 = group_anagrams(strs3)
print(result3)  # Output: [['a']]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`defaultdict(list)`:**
    *   We use `defaultdict(list)` from the `collections` module.  This is a dictionary-like structure where, if you try to access a key that doesn't exist, it automatically creates that key with a default value (in this case, an empty list). This simplifies the code and avoids needing to check if a key exists before appending to its associated list.

2.  **Iterate through Strings:**
    *   The code iterates through each string `s` in the input list `strs`.

3.  **Sort Characters:**
    *   `sorted(s)` returns a list of characters in the string `s` sorted alphabetically.
    *   `"".join(sorted(s))` converts the sorted list of characters back into a string.  This sorted string serves as a unique key for all anagrams of `s`.  For example, "eat", "tea", and "ate" will all have the key "aet".

4.  **Group by Sorted String:**
    *   `anagram_groups[sorted_s].append(s)`: The code appends the original string `s` to the list associated with the `sorted_s` key in the `anagram_groups` dictionary.  This effectively groups all anagrams together under the same key.

5.  **Return Values:**
    *   `list(anagram_groups.values())`: Finally, the code returns a list of all the *values* in the `anagram_groups` dictionary.  The values are the lists of anagrams that were grouped together.  The `list()` conversion ensures that the result is a list (rather than a `dict_values` object).

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K log K), where N is the number of strings in the input list and K is the maximum length of a string.  The `sorted()` operation on a string of length K takes O(K log K) time.  We perform this operation for each of the N strings.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N * K), where N is the number of strings and K is the maximum length of the string. In the worst case, all strings are unique, and we store all of them along with their sorted representations in the `anagram_groups` dictionary.
