Okay, here's a problem with a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == lists.length`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Solution (Python):**

```python
import heapq

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of ListNode objects, each representing a sorted linked list.

    Returns:
        A ListNode object representing the head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    heap = []  # Min-heap to store nodes
    for i in range(len(lists)):
        if lists[i]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i, lists[i]))  # (value, list_index, node)

    dummy = ListNode()  # Dummy node for the merged list
    tail = dummy

    while heap:
        val, list_index, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        tail.next = node
        tail = tail.next

        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, list_index, node.next))

    return dummy.next

# Example usage:
# Create sample linked lists
list1 = ListNode(1, ListNode(4, ListNode(5)))
list2 = ListNode(1, ListNode(3, ListNode(4)))
list3 = ListNode(2, ListNode(6))

lists = [list1, list2, list3]

merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

# Print the merged list (for verification)
def print_list(head):
    result = []
    while head:
        result.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    print(result)

print_list(merged_list) # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ListNode` Class:** Defines the structure of a node in the linked list.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**
    *   **Heap Initialization:** A min-heap `heap` is used to efficiently find the smallest node among all the lists. The heap stores tuples of the form `(node.val, list_index, node)`. The `list_index` is added in tuple to resolve comparison among nodes that have the same value.
    *   **Initial Heap Population:** Iterate through the `lists` array.  If a list is not empty (i.e., it has a head node), push its head node's value and index and node to the heap.
    *   **Dummy Node:** Create a `dummy` node, which will be the starting point of the merged list. `tail` pointer is used to keep track of the current end of the merged list.
    *   **Heap Processing:**
        *   While the heap is not empty, extract the smallest node (`val`, `list_index`, `node`) from the heap using `heapq.heappop()`.
        *   Append the extracted node to the merged list: `tail.next = node`, then move the `tail` pointer.
        *   If the extracted node has a next node, push the next node's value along with it's index and node to the heap.
    *   **Return:**  Return `dummy.next`, which is the head of the merged sorted linked list.

**Key Concepts Used:**

*   **Linked Lists:**  Fundamental data structure.
*   **Min-Heap (Priority Queue):**  Used to efficiently find the smallest element among multiple lists.  The `heapq` module in Python provides an implementation of a min-heap. The standard library's `heapq` only supports a tuple's comparison when the first value in the tuple is different.
*   **Time Complexity: O(N log k)**, where `N` is the total number of nodes across all lists, and `k` is the number of lists.  Each node is added to and removed from the heap once. Heap operations take O(log k) time.
*   **Space Complexity: O(k)**, where `k` is the number of linked lists. This is due to the space used by the min-heap.  In the worst case, the heap will contain one node from each of the `k` lists. If the lists are very unbalanced, the space complexity could potentially increase closer to O(N) in extreme scenarios if almost all the initial nodes are small.
