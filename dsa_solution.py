Okay, here's a random DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists `lists`, where each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == len(lists)`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other): # Important for heapq!
        return self.val < other.val

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of k sorted linked lists.

    Returns:
        The head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    heap = []

    # Push the head nodes of all linked lists into the heap
    for node in lists:
        if node:  # Check if the list is not empty
            heapq.heappush(heap, node)

    # Create a dummy node to start the merged list
    dummy = ListNode()
    tail = dummy

    # While the heap is not empty
    while heap:
        # Pop the node with the smallest value
        node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        tail.next = node
        tail = tail.next

        # If the popped node has a next node, push it into the heap
        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, node.next)

    return dummy.next

# Helper function to create a linked list from a list of values
def create_linked_list(values):
    if not values:
        return None
    head = ListNode(values[0])
    curr = head
    for val in values[1:]:
        curr.next = ListNode(val)
        curr = curr.next
    return head

# Helper function to print a linked list
def print_linked_list(head):
    curr = head
    while curr:
        print(curr.val, end=" -> ")
        curr = curr.next
    print("None")


# Example Usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    list1 = create_linked_list([1, 4, 5])
    list2 = create_linked_list([1, 3, 4])
    list3 = create_linked_list([2, 6])

    lists = [list1, list2, list3]
    merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

    print("Merged List:")
    print_linked_list(merged_list)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **ListNode Class:**  Defines a simple linked list node with a `val` and a `next` pointer.  Crucially, it includes the `__lt__` method, which allows the `heapq` library to correctly compare `ListNode` objects based on their `val` attribute.  This is essential for the min-heap to work correctly.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**

    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `heap`: A min-heap (priority queue) implemented using `heapq`. We will store the *head nodes* of the linked lists in this heap.  The heap will always keep the smallest node at the top.
        *   `dummy`: A dummy `ListNode` is created.  This is a common technique in linked list problems to simplify the handling of the head of the merged list. We'll use it to build our merged list.
        *   `tail`: A pointer that initially points to the dummy node.  It will be used to traverse and append to the merged list.

    *   **Heap Population:**
        *   The code iterates through the `lists` array.
        *   For each linked list, if the list is not empty (`if node:`), the *head node* is pushed onto the `heap`.  The `heapq.heappush` function maintains the heap property, ensuring that the smallest node is always at the top.

    *   **Merging:**
        *   The `while heap:` loop continues as long as there are nodes in the heap.
        *   `heapq.heappop(heap)`: The node with the smallest value is popped from the heap (this is the top of the min-heap).
        *   `tail.next = node`: The popped node is appended to the `tail` of the merged list.
        *   `tail = tail.next`: The `tail` pointer is moved to the newly added node.
        *   `if node.next:`:  If the popped node has a `next` node (i.e., it's not the end of its original linked list), the `next` node is pushed onto the heap.  This ensures that we consider the remaining nodes in that list for merging.

    *   **Return:**
        *   Finally, `dummy.next` is returned.  This is the head of the merged sorted linked list (skipping the dummy node).

3.  **Helper Functions (`create_linked_list`, `print_linked_list`):** These are utility functions to create and print linked lists for testing purposes.

**Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all linked lists, and k is the number of linked lists.  The `heapq.heappush` and `heapq.heappop` operations take O(log k) time, and we perform these operations for each of the N nodes.

**Space Complexity:** O(k).  The heap stores at most one node from each of the k linked lists.
