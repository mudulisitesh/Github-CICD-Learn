Okay, here's a problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge Overlapping Intervals**

Given a list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a pair `[start, end]`, merge all overlapping intervals and return a list of non-overlapping intervals that cover the same range.

**Example:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Code (Python):**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
  """
  Merges overlapping intervals in a list.

  Args:
    intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list [start, end].

  Returns:
    A list of non-overlapping intervals.
  """

  # If the input is empty or contains only one interval, return the input itself
  if not intervals or len(intervals) <= 1:
    return intervals

  # Sort the intervals based on the start time.  Crucial for the algorithm to work.
  intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

  merged = []
  current_interval = intervals[0]

  for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
    next_interval = intervals[i]

    # Check for overlap
    if current_interval[1] >= next_interval[0]:
      # Merge the intervals
      current_interval[1] = max(current_interval[1], next_interval[1]) # Extend the end
    else:
      # No overlap, add the current interval to the result and move to the next
      merged.append(current_interval)
      current_interval = next_interval

  # Add the last interval to the result
  merged.append(current_interval)

  return merged

# Example usage
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
result = merge_intervals(intervals)
print(result)  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
result2 = merge_intervals(intervals2)
print(result2) # Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
result3 = merge_intervals(intervals3)
print(result3) # Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
result4 = merge_intervals(intervals4)
print(result4) # Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sorting:**  The most important step is sorting the intervals based on their start times. This ensures that we can iterate through the intervals and determine overlap in a consistent manner.  `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` does this efficiently. The `lambda` function provides the sorting key (the start time of each interval).

2. **Initialization:**  We initialize an empty list `merged` to store the merged intervals.  We also initialize `current_interval` with the first interval in the sorted list.

3. **Iteration:** We iterate through the rest of the sorted intervals.  For each `next_interval`:

   - **Overlap Check:**  We check if `current_interval` and `next_interval` overlap.  They overlap if the end of `current_interval` is greater than or equal to the start of `next_interval`. `current_interval[1] >= next_interval[0]`

   - **Merge (if Overlap):** If they overlap, we update the `current_interval` to merge them.  Crucially, we take the *maximum* of the end times:  `current_interval[1] = max(current_interval[1], next_interval[1])`.  This ensures that the merged interval encompasses the entire range of both overlapping intervals.

   - **No Overlap:** If they *don't* overlap, it means we've finished processing the `current_interval`.  We append it to the `merged` list and then set the `current_interval` to `next_interval` to start a new merged interval.

4. **Final Append:**  After the loop finishes, we need to add the last `current_interval` to the `merged` list, as it might not have been added inside the loop.

5. **Return:** Finally, we return the `merged` list of non-overlapping intervals.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step.  The rest of the algorithm is O(n), but sorting dominates.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where there are no overlapping intervals, and we store all the intervals in the `merged` list.  It could be O(1) if you modify the original `intervals` list in place (but that changes the function's behavior, and I prefer to return a new list).
