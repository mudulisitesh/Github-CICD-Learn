Okay, here's a DSA problem focusing on string manipulation and a corresponding Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Palindrome Substring Removal**

You are given a string `s`.  In one step, you can remove any contiguous palindromic substring from `s`. What is the minimum number of steps to remove all characters from the string `s`?

**Example:**

*   `s = "ababa"`:  You can remove the entire string in one step (because "ababa" is a palindrome).
*   `s = "abbc"`: You can remove "bb" in one step, leaving "ac". Then remove "a" and "c" in two separate steps. Total steps: 3.
*   `s = "abaacca"`: You can remove "aa" in one step, leaving "abaacc". Then remove "aba" in one step, leaving "cc". Finally remove "cc" in one step. Total steps: 3.
*   `s = "abcddcba"`: You can remove the entire string in one step since it is a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `len(s)` <= 100
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def min_palindrome_removal(s):
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of steps to remove all characters from a string
    by removing contiguous palindromic substrings.

    Args:
        s: The input string.

    Returns:
        The minimum number of steps required.
    """

    n = len(s)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 1  # Single character is a palindrome

    for length in range(2, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1

            if s[i] == s[j]:
                if length == 2:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 # Two same characters form a palindrome
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] #Check if removing s[i] and s[j] results in palindrome.
            
            if dp[i][j] == 0:
              dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] for k in range(i, j))

    return dp[0][n - 1]


# Example Usage:
print(min_palindrome_removal("ababa"))  # Output: 1
print(min_palindrome_removal("abbc"))  # Output: 3
print(min_palindrome_removal("abaacca")) # Output: 3
print(min_palindrome_removal("abcddcba")) # Output: 1
print(min_palindrome_removal("abcd")) # Output 4
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Dynamic Programming:** The solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently determine the minimum steps.  `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum number of steps needed to remove the substring `s[i:j+1]`.

2.  **Base Case:**  `dp[i][i] = 1` because a single character is a palindrome and requires one step to remove.

3.  **Iteration:**
    *   We iterate through all possible substring lengths (from 2 to `n`).
    *   For each length, we iterate through all possible starting positions `i`.
    *   `j = i + length - 1` calculates the ending position of the substring.

4.  **Palindrome Check:**
    *   If `s[i] == s[j]`, the first and last characters are the same.  Then, we consider if the substring between `i+1` and `j-1` is also a palindrome.
       * If the length is exactly 2, then since s[i] == s[j], we have a palindrome of length 2. Thus, dp[i][j] = 1.
       * Otherwise, we check if `dp[i+1][j-1]` is also a palindrome, if that is the case then `dp[i][j] = 1` since we can remove the palindrome.

5.  **Non-Palindrome Case:**
    * If the substring is not a palindrome. Then we have to split it into subproblems.  We try splitting at all possible indices `k` between `i` and `j-1`.
    * `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] for k in range(i, j))` This line calculates the minimum steps by considering all possible split points `k` within the substring `s[i:j+1]`. It takes the minimum of (steps to remove `s[i:k+1]`) + (steps to remove `s[k+1:j+1]`).

6.  **Result:**  `dp[0][n - 1]` contains the minimum number of steps to remove the entire string `s`.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n<sup>3</sup>) due to the three nested loops (two for iterating through substrings and one for the splitting point `k`).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup>) for the `dp` table.

**Key Improvements over Naive Recursion:**

*   Dynamic programming avoids recomputing the same subproblems multiple times, which is what a naive recursive approach would do.  This significantly improves the efficiency.  The overlapping subproblems are efficiently solved using memoization (or, in this case, a bottom-up approach).
