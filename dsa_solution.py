Okay, here's a DSA problem focusing on using a hash table (dictionary in Python) for efficient counting and comparison, along with a Python solution:

**Problem: Anagram Grouping**

Given a list of strings, group the anagrams together.  An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example:**

```
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
```

**Explanation:**

*   "eat", "tea", and "ate" are anagrams of each other.
*   "tan" and "nat" are anagrams of each other.
*   "bat" has no anagrams in the input list.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def group_anagrams(strs):
    """
    Groups anagrams from a list of strings.

    Args:
        strs: A list of strings.

    Returns:
        A list of lists, where each inner list contains anagrams.
    """

    anagram_map = {}  # Dictionary to store sorted strings as keys and anagram lists as values

    for string in strs:
        # Sort the characters of the string to create a unique key for anagrams
        sorted_string = "".join(sorted(string))

        if sorted_string in anagram_map:
            anagram_map[sorted_string].append(string)  # Add the string to the existing anagram group
        else:
            anagram_map[sorted_string] = [string]  # Create a new anagram group

    return list(anagram_map.values())  # Return the list of anagram groups


# Example Usage:
input_strings = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
result = group_anagrams(input_strings)
print(result) # Output: [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]

input_strings = [""]
result = group_anagrams(input_strings)
print(result) #Output: [['']]

input_strings = ["a"]
result = group_anagrams(input_strings)
print(result) #Output: [['a']]
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`group_anagrams(strs)` function:**
    *   Takes a list of strings `strs` as input.
    *   Initializes an empty dictionary `anagram_map`. This dictionary will store sorted versions of the strings (which are unique identifiers for anagrams) as keys, and lists of the actual anagram strings as values.

2.  **Iterating through the Input:**
    *   The code iterates through each `string` in the input list `strs`.

3.  **Sorting the String (Creating the Key):**
    *   `sorted_string = "".join(sorted(string))` : This is the crucial part.
        *   `sorted(string)`: Sorts the characters of the current `string` alphabetically, resulting in a list of characters.
        *   `"".join(...)`: Joins the sorted list of characters back into a single string.  This sorted string serves as a unique key for all anagrams of that string. For example, "eat", "tea", and "ate" will all result in the sorted string "aet".

4.  **Checking the Dictionary:**
    *   `if sorted_string in anagram_map:`: Checks if the `sorted_string` already exists as a key in the `anagram_map` dictionary.
        *   If it exists, it means we've already found anagrams of this type.  So, `anagram_map[sorted_string].append(string)` appends the current `string` to the list of anagrams associated with that key.
    *   `else:`: If the `sorted_string` is not in `anagram_map`, it means this is the first time we've encountered an anagram of this type.
        *   `anagram_map[sorted_string] = [string]` creates a new entry in the dictionary, using the `sorted_string` as the key and a new list containing only the current `string` as the value. This starts a new group of anagrams.

5.  **Returning the Result:**
    *   `return list(anagram_map.values())`:  After processing all the strings, `anagram_map` contains all the anagram groups.  `anagram_map.values()` returns a collection of the values (which are the lists of anagrams).  `list(...)` converts this collection into a list of lists, which is the desired output format.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K log K), where N is the number of strings in the input list and K is the average length of the strings.  We iterate through each string (N), and for each string, we sort it (K log K).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N * K), where N is the number of strings and K is the average length of the strings. In the worst case, we might store all the strings in the `anagram_map`.
