Okay, here's a random DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Valid Parentheses with Wildcards**

Given a string `s` containing only three characters: `(`, `)`, and `*`, determine if the string is valid.

A string is valid if:

1.  Every left parenthesis `(` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `)`.
2.  Every right parenthesis `)` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `(`.
3.  Left parenthesis `(` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `)`.
4.  `*` could be treated as a single right parenthesis `)`, a single left parenthesis `(`, or an empty string.
5.  An empty string is also valid.

**Example:**

*   Input: `s = "(*)"`
*   Output: `True`

*   Input: `s = "(*))"`
*   Output: `True`

*   Input: `s = "((*)"`
*   Output: `True`

*   Input: `s = "(()((((*)"`
*   Output: `False`

**Python Solution:**

```python
def check_valid_string(s: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a string containing '(', ')', and '*' is a valid parentheses string.

    Args:
        s: The input string.

    Returns:
        True if the string is valid, False otherwise.
    """

    low = 0  # Minimum number of open parentheses needed
    high = 0 # Maximum number of open parentheses possible

    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            low += 1
            high += 1
        elif char == ')':
            low -= 1
            high -= 1
        else:  # char == '*'
            low -= 1  # Treat as ')'
            high += 1  # Treat as '('

        low = max(low, 0)  # Ensure low doesn't go negative
        if high < 0:       # Early exit if high goes negative
            return False

    return low == 0 #String is valid if we can get to low == 0

# Example usage
print(check_valid_string("(*)"))    # True
print(check_valid_string("(*))"))   # True
print(check_valid_string("((*)"))   # True
print(check_valid_string("(()((((*)")) # False
print(check_valid_string("()"))     #True
print(check_valid_string(")"))      #False
print(check_valid_string("("))      #False
print(check_valid_string("*"))      #True
print(check_valid_string("(*("))    #False
print(check_valid_string("(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((()")) #False

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`low` and `high` Variables:**
    *   `low`:  Represents the minimum possible number of unmatched open parentheses if we interpret '*' optimally to minimize open parentheses.  We decrement it if we encounter a `)` or a `*` (treating `*` as `)`). It represents the worst-case scenario for having too few opening parentheses.
    *   `high`: Represents the maximum possible number of unmatched open parentheses if we interpret '*' optimally to maximize open parentheses. We increment it if we encounter a `(` or a `*` (treating `*` as `(`). It represents the worst-case scenario for having too many opening parentheses.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   We iterate through the string `s` character by character.
    *   For each character:
        *   `(`: Both `low` and `high` are incremented because we definitely have one more unmatched open parenthesis.
        *   `)`: Both `low` and `high` are decremented because we definitely have one less unmatched open parenthesis.
        *   `*`: `low` is decremented (treating `*` as a closing parenthesis), and `high` is incremented (treating `*` as an opening parenthesis). This explores both possibilities.

3.  **`low = max(low, 0)`:**
    *   `low` cannot be negative.  If it becomes negative, it means we have more closing parentheses than opening parentheses, even when we treat all `*` as opening parentheses up to that point.  So, we set `low` to 0, essentially ignoring any surplus closing parentheses we encountered.

4.  **`if high < 0: return False`:**
    *   If `high` ever becomes negative, it means we have more closing parentheses than opening parentheses, even when we treat all `*` as opening parentheses.  This is an immediate indication that the string is invalid, so we return `False`.

5.  **`return low == 0`:**
    *   After processing the entire string, the string is valid if and only if `low` is 0. `low` represents the minimum number of unmatched open parentheses we could have, and if that's 0, it means there's a way to match all the parentheses using the flexibility of the `*`.  If `low` is greater than 0, it means no matter how we interpret the `*`, we'll still have unmatched open parentheses.

**Time and Space Complexity**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.  We iterate through the string once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).  We use only a constant amount of extra space to store the `low` and `high` variables.
