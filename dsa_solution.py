Okay, here's a random DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Group Anagrams**

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together.  You can return the answer in **any order**.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
*   `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

**Python Solution:**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs):
    """
    Groups anagrams from a list of strings.

    Args:
        strs: A list of strings.

    Returns:
        A list of lists, where each inner list contains anagrams.
    """
    anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)  # Dictionary to store anagrams
    for s in strs:
        # Sort the string to create a canonical representation for anagrams
        sorted_s = "".join(sorted(s))
        anagram_groups[sorted_s].append(s)
    return list(anagram_groups.values())

# Example Usage:
strs1 = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
print(groupAnagrams(strs1)) # Output: [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']] (order may vary)

strs2 = [""]
print(groupAnagrams(strs2))  # Output: [['']]

strs3 = ["a"]
print(groupAnagrams(strs3))  # Output: [['a']]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`defaultdict(list)`:** We use a `defaultdict(list)` which is a specialized dictionary. If you try to access a key that doesn't exist, it automatically creates that key with an empty list as its value. This is perfect for grouping elements.

2.  **Sorting for Canonical Representation:** The core idea is that anagrams will have the same letters, just in different orders.  If we sort the letters of each word, we'll get the same string for all anagrams.  For example, "eat", "tea", and "ate" all become "aet" when sorted.  This sorted string becomes the key in our `anagram_groups` dictionary.

3.  **Iteration and Grouping:**  We iterate through the input list of strings `strs`. For each string `s`:
    *   We sort it using `sorted(s)` (which returns a list of characters) and then join the sorted characters back into a string using `"".join(...)`.
    *   We use this sorted string as the key in `anagram_groups`, and we `append` the original string `s` to the list associated with that key.

4.  **Returning the Groups:** Finally, `anagram_groups.values()` gives us a collection of lists (the values in the dictionary), where each list contains the strings that are anagrams of each other.  We convert this collection to a regular list using `list(...)` and return it.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K log K), where N is the number of strings in the input list and K is the average length of the strings. This is because we iterate through each string (O(N)), and for each string, we sort it (O(K log K)).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N * K), where N is the number of strings and K is the average length of the strings. In the worst case, all strings are unique and have distinct characters, so we store all the strings in the `anagram_groups` dictionary.
