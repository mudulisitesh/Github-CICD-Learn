Okay, here's a DSA problem and its solution in Python.

**Problem:  "Meeting Rooms"**

Given an array of meeting time intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, determine if a person could attend all meetings.

**Example:**

```
intervals = [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: false
```

```
intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: true
```

**Explanation:**

The first example shows overlapping meeting times.  The second shows meetings that don't overlap.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def can_attend_all_meetings(intervals):
    """
    Determines if a person can attend all meetings given a list of meeting intervals.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of lists, where each inner list represents a meeting interval [start, end].

    Returns:
        True if the person can attend all meetings, False otherwise.
    """

    # Sort the intervals by their start times. This is crucial for the algorithm.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Use a lambda function to sort by the first element (start time)

    # Iterate through the sorted intervals and check for overlaps.
    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        # If the current meeting starts before the previous meeting ends, there's an overlap.
        if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]:
            return False  # Overlap found, can't attend all meetings

    # If we reach here without finding any overlaps, the person can attend all meetings.
    return True


# Example Usage:
intervals1 = [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
intervals2 = [[7,10],[2,4]]
intervals3 = [[13,15],[1,13]]
intervals4 = []  # Empty list - should return True (no meetings)
intervals5 = [[9,10],[4,9],[4,17]]


print(f"Intervals: {intervals1}, Can attend all meetings: {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals1)}")  # Output: False
print(f"Intervals: {intervals2}, Can attend all meetings: {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals2)}")  # Output: True
print(f"Intervals: {intervals3}, Can attend all meetings: {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals3)}")  # Output: True
print(f"Intervals: {intervals4}, Can attend all meetings: {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals4)}")  # Output: True
print(f"Intervals: {intervals5}, Can attend all meetings: {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals5)}") # Output: False
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Sorting:** The `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` line is the most important part. We sort the intervals based on their starting times. This allows us to easily check for overlaps by comparing adjacent intervals.  Sorting is done in place.  The `key` argument specifies a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons. Here, it tells the sort to use the first element of each sublist for comparison.

2. **Overlap Detection:** The code then iterates through the sorted intervals, starting from the second interval (index 1). For each interval, it checks if its start time (`intervals[i][0]`) is less than the end time of the previous interval (`intervals[i - 1][1]`). If this condition is true, it means the current meeting overlaps with the previous meeting, and the function immediately returns `False`.

3. **No Overlaps:** If the loop completes without finding any overlaps, it means the person can attend all meetings, and the function returns `True`.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals.  The sorting step dominates the time complexity. The rest of the algorithm is O(n).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1)  (in-place sorting).  If the sorting algorithm used by `intervals.sort()` in Python has O(n) space complexity (e.g., merge sort), the space complexity would become O(n) in the worst case.

**How to Run the Code:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `meeting_rooms.py`).
2.  Run the file from your terminal using `python meeting_rooms.py`.  The output will show the results for the example intervals.

This is a classic interval-related problem and a good example of how sorting can simplify the solution. Remember to understand the problem thoroughly and consider edge cases (like an empty list of intervals) when writing your code.
