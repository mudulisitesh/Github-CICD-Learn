Okay, here's a DSA problem and a Python solution.

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Linked Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Solution (Python):**

```python
import heapq

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
      lists: A list of ListNode objects, where each ListNode is the head of a sorted linked list.

    Returns:
      The head of the merged sorted linked list, or None if the input list is empty or contains only empty lists.
    """

    heap = []

    # Add the head of each linked list to the min-heap.  Use index for tiebreaking
    for i, head in enumerate(lists):
        if head:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (head.val, i, head))

    # Create a dummy node to simplify the merging process.
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy

    while heap:
        # Get the smallest node from the heap.
        val, index, node = heapq.heappop(heap)

        # Append the node to the merged list.
        current.next = node
        current = current.next

        # Add the next node from the same list to the heap (if it exists).
        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, index, node.next))

    return dummy.next


# Example Usage (create linked lists for testing)
# Helper function to create a linked list from a list of values
def create_linked_list(values):
    if not values:
        return None
    head = ListNode(values[0])
    current = head
    for i in range(1, len(values)):
        current.next = ListNode(values[i])
        current = current.next
    return head

# Helper function to convert a linked list to a list of values for testing
def linked_list_to_list(head):
    result = []
    current = head
    while current:
        result.append(current.val)
        current = current.next
    return result

# Create sample linked lists
list1 = create_linked_list([1, 4, 5])
list2 = create_linked_list([1, 3, 4])
list3 = create_linked_list([2, 6])

lists = [list1, list2, list3]

# Merge the linked lists
merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

# Print the merged list
print(linked_list_to_list(merged_list)) # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]

# Test case 2:  Empty list
lists2 = []
merged_list2 = mergeKLists(lists2)
print(linked_list_to_list(merged_list2)) # Output: []

# Test case 3:  List with empty lists
list4 = create_linked_list([])
list5 = create_linked_list([2,5,7])
list6 = create_linked_list([])

lists3 = [list4, list5, list6]

merged_list3 = mergeKLists(lists3)
print(linked_list_to_list(merged_list3)) #Output: [2, 5, 7]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ListNode` Class:**  A standard node class for a singly linked list.

2. **`mergeKLists(lists)` function:**
   - **Min-Heap:** The core idea is to use a min-heap to efficiently keep track of the smallest nodes among all the input linked lists.  A min-heap allows us to quickly retrieve the node with the smallest value.
   - **Initialization:** We iterate through the input `lists`.  For each non-empty linked list, we add the head node to the min-heap. The min-heap stores tuples of the form `(node.val, index, node)`, where `node.val` is the value of the node, `index` is the index of the list the node came from (important for tiebreaking in heapq) and `node` is the actual ListNode object.  The index is crucial in Python's `heapq` implementation for handling cases where nodes have the same value, preventing errors.
   - **Dummy Node:** A dummy node is used as a starting point for building the merged linked list.  This simplifies the code, avoiding special cases for handling the first node.
   - **Merging Loop:**
     - While the heap is not empty:
       - `heapq.heappop(heap)`: We extract the node with the smallest value from the heap.
       - `current.next = node`: We append this node to the merged list.
       - `current = current.next`: We move the `current` pointer to the newly added node.
       - `if node.next`: If the extracted node has a `next` node in its original list, we add that `next` node to the heap, ensuring that we continue to consider nodes from that list.
   - **Return `dummy.next`:**  Finally, we return the `next` pointer of the dummy node, which points to the head of the merged sorted linked list.

3. **Helper functions (`create_linked_list`, `linked_list_to_list`):**  These functions are included for creating linked lists from Python lists for testing and for converting the resulting linked list back to a list for easy verification.

**Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all the linked lists and k is the number of linked lists.  The `heapq` operations (push and pop) take O(log k) time, and we perform these operations N times.

**Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of linked lists. This is the space used by the min-heap.  In the worst case, the heap will contain one node from each of the k linked lists.
