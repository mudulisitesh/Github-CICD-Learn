Okay, here's a DSA problem and a working Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Linked Lists**

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == len(lists)`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Code Solution (using a min-heap):**

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of linked lists, where each linked list is sorted.

    Returns:
        The head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    heap = []  # Min-heap to store the head nodes of the linked lists.  Store tuples (val, list_index)
    head = point = ListNode(0)

    # Initialize the heap with the head nodes of the non-empty lists
    for i in range(len(lists)):
        if lists[i]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i)) #use list idx to avoid comparison error with Node object.
            lists[i] = lists[i].next # Move pointer to next node in the list

    while heap:
        val, list_index = heapq.heappop(heap)
        point.next = ListNode(val)
        point = point.next

        if lists[list_index]:  # If the list still has nodes
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[list_index].val, list_index))
            lists[list_index] = lists[list_index].next

    return head.next

# Example Usage (Create the linked lists and test)
# Create list1: 1 -> 4 -> 5
head1 = ListNode(1)
head1.next = ListNode(4)
head1.next.next = ListNode(5)

# Create list2: 1 -> 3 -> 4
head2 = ListNode(1)
head2.next = ListNode(3)
head2.next.next = ListNode(4)

# Create list3: 2 -> 6
head3 = ListNode(2)
head3.next = ListNode(6)

lists = [head1, head2, head3]

merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

# Print the merged list
while merged_list:
    print(merged_list.val, end=" ")
    merged_list = merged_list.next
print() #newline after printing.
```

Key improvements and explanations:

*   **Min-Heap:** The core idea is to use a min-heap to efficiently track the smallest element across all `k` lists.  The `heapq` module in Python provides an efficient implementation of a min-heap.
*   **ListNode Class:**  The `ListNode` class is defined to represent a node in the linked list, as required by the problem description.
*   **Heap Initialization:** The code initializes the heap with the head nodes of all the *non-empty* lists. This is important to avoid errors when dealing with empty input lists.
*   **Heap Updates:** Inside the `while heap` loop, the smallest element is extracted from the heap, added to the merged list, and then the next element (if any) from the list from which the smallest element was extracted is added back into the heap.
*   **Dummy Head:**  A dummy head node (`head = point = ListNode(0)`) is used to simplify the logic of building the merged list.  This avoids having to handle the special case of adding the first element. The method then returns `head.next` which is the head of the real merged list, skipping the dummy node.
*   **`list_index` Tracking:** The code now correctly uses tuples of the form `(value, list_index)` in the heap. This is CRUCIAL for two reasons:
    1.  It allows the code to retrieve the correct list from `lists` when an element is popped from the heap. Without this, you wouldn't know which list the minimum value came from.
    2.  It avoids comparison errors.  When you `heapq.heappush` a node, the `heapq` library needs to be able to compare the objects in the heap. It can compare integers, but if you were to push the `ListNode` object directly into the heap, it wouldn't know how to compare one ListNode to another. The `list_index` helps avoid that error.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The `if lists[list_index]` condition inside the `while heap` loop handles the case where a list becomes empty during the merging process.
*   **Clarity and Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain the purpose of each section and the logic behind the algorithm.
*   **Complete Example:** I've added example usage to create sample linked lists and demonstrate how to use the `mergeKLists` function.  This makes it easy to test the code.
* **Lists Modification** `lists[i] = lists[i].next` modifies the original lists. I've added a comment clarifying this. This might be a concern depending on the requirements of the problem if the caller should not see the modified lists. A copy of `lists` could be made to avoid modifying the original lists.

**Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes across all linked lists, and k is the number of linked lists.  Each insertion and deletion from the heap takes O(log k) time, and we perform these operations N times.

**Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of linked lists, for the min-heap.  In the worst case, the heap will contain one element from each of the k lists.
