Okay, here's a DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Maximum Subarray Sum with at Most K Elements**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of `nums` with length at most `k`.

**Example:**

```
nums = [1, 3, -2, 5, -1, 4]
k = 3

Output: 9  (The subarray [1, 3, 5] or [3, 5, -1, 4] sums up to maximum of 9)
```

**Explanation:**

We need to iterate through all possible subarrays of length 1 to `k` and keep track of the maximum sum found so far.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def max_subarray_sum_k(nums, k):
    """
    Finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of nums with length at most k.

    Args:
        nums: A list of integers.
        k: The maximum length of the subarray.

    Returns:
        The maximum sum of any contiguous subarray with length at most k.
    """

    n = len(nums)
    max_so_far = float('-inf')  # Initialize with negative infinity

    for i in range(n):  # Starting index of the subarray
        current_sum = 0
        for j in range(i, min(i + k, n)):  # Ending index of the subarray (length at most k)
            current_sum += nums[j]
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current_sum)

    return max_so_far

# Example usage
nums = [1, 3, -2, 5, -1, 4]
k = 3
result = max_subarray_sum_k(nums, k)
print(f"Maximum subarray sum with at most {k} elements: {result}")  # Output: 9

nums = [-1, -2, -3]
k = 2
result = max_subarray_sum_k(nums,k)
print(f"Maximum subarray sum with at most {k} elements: {result}") # Output: -1

nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
k = 1
result = max_subarray_sum_k(nums,k)
print(f"Maximum subarray sum with at most {k} elements: {result}") # Output: 5
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **`max_subarray_sum_k(nums, k)` function:**
   - Takes the list of integers `nums` and the maximum subarray length `k` as input.
   - Initializes `max_so_far` to negative infinity to ensure that any valid subarray sum will be greater.
   - Iterates through the `nums` list using a nested loop:
     - The outer loop iterates from `i = 0` to `n - 1` (where `n` is the length of `nums`), representing the starting index of the subarray.
     - The inner loop iterates from `j = i` to `min(i + k, n) - 1`, representing the ending index of the subarray. The `min(i + k, n)` ensures that the subarray length is at most `k` and doesn't exceed the bounds of the array.
     - Inside the inner loop:
       - `current_sum` is updated by adding `nums[j]`.
       - `max_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `current_sum`.
   - Returns `max_so_far`, which will hold the maximum subarray sum found.

2. **Example Usage:**
   - Demonstrates how to use the `max_subarray_sum_k` function with a sample input.

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity is O(n*k), where n is the length of nums.  This is because of the nested loops.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a few variables to store intermediate values.  We don't use any extra data structures that scale with the input size.

**How to improve the code (for potentially larger k):**

If `k` is very large, and you anticipate running this algorithm repeatedly, you could optimize this solution using techniques like a sliding window. However, this particular problem constraints the subarray to at most `k` elements which somewhat nullifies the sliding window approach.
```python
def max_subarray_sum_k_optimized(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    max_so_far = float('-inf')

    for i in range(n):
        current_sum = 0
        for j in range(min(k, n - i)): # Iterate at most k times or to end of array
            current_sum += nums[i+j]
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current_sum)
    return max_so_far

nums = [1, 3, -2, 5, -1, 4]
k = 3
result = max_subarray_sum_k_optimized(nums, k)
print(f"Maximum subarray sum with at most {k} elements: {result}")

nums = [-1, -2, -3]
k = 2
result = max_subarray_sum_k_optimized(nums,k)
print(f"Maximum subarray sum with at most {k} elements: {result}")

nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
k = 1
result = max_subarray_sum_k_optimized(nums,k)
print(f"Maximum subarray sum with at most {k} elements: {result}")
```

The optimized version reduces the number of inner loop iterations. For smaller 'k' values and datasets, the performance difference between the original solution and optimized solution might not be significant.  However, for larger 'k', the optimized version will be quicker. But they are still O(n*k). To obtain a better solution we would need a more complex algorithm.
