Okay, here's a DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:  Merge Intervals**

Given a collection of intervals represented as pairs of integers (start, end), merge all overlapping intervals.  Return a new sorted list of non-overlapping intervals representing the merged intervals.

**Example:**

Input: `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

Explanation: `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,6]`.

Input: `intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`
Output: `[[1,5]]`

**Python Solution:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two integers [start, end].

    Returns:
        A new list of non-overlapping intervals representing the merged intervals.
    """

    # Sort intervals by their start times.  This is crucial for the algorithm.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  #Sort in ascending order based on x[0]

    merged = []

    for interval in intervals:
        # If the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
        # interval does not overlap with the last interval, simply append it.
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current interval
            # with the last interval.  The end is the max of the two.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

    return merged

# Example usage:
intervals1 = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
result1 = merge_intervals(intervals1)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals1}: {result1}")  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
result2 = merge_intervals(intervals2)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals2}: {result2}")  # Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
result3 = merge_intervals(intervals3)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals3}: {result3}")  # Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
result4 = merge_intervals(intervals4)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals4}: {result4}")  # Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]

intervals5 = [[1,4],[0,2],[3,5]]
result5 = merge_intervals(intervals5)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals5}: {result5}")  # Output: [[0, 5]]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Intervals:** The first step is to sort the intervals based on their starting times.  This is the most important part of the algorithm.  Sorting allows us to process the intervals in order, efficiently checking for overlaps.  The `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` line uses a lambda function to define the sorting key as the first element (start time) of each interval.

2. **Iterate and Merge:**
   - We initialize an empty list `merged` to store the resulting merged intervals.
   - We iterate through the sorted `intervals` list.
   - **No Overlap:** If the `merged` list is empty (first interval) or the current interval's start time is greater than the end time of the last interval in `merged` (no overlap), we simply append the current interval to `merged`.
   - **Overlap:** If there's an overlap (the current interval's start time is less than or equal to the end time of the last interval in `merged`), we merge the intervals.  We update the end time of the last interval in `merged` to be the maximum of the original end time and the end time of the current interval. This ensures that we extend the merged interval to cover the entire overlapping range.

3. **Return:** Finally, we return the `merged` list, which contains the non-overlapping, merged intervals.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step.  The rest of the algorithm takes O(n) time.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where no intervals overlap, and the `merged` list contains all the original intervals.  O(1) in the best case, where all intervals are merged into one. (Not considering the space for the original input.)  The space complexity also depends on the in-place sorting algorithm used.  Python's `sort()` is generally Timsort, which has good average and worst-case space complexity.
