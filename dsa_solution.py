Okay, here's a problem and a Python solution.

**Problem: Find the Missing Number in a Range**

You are given an array `nums` containing distinct numbers taken from the range `[0, n]`.  That is, the array should contain all the numbers between 0 and *n*, inclusive, except for one missing number.  Find the missing number.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]
Output: 2

Input: nums = [0, 1]
Output: 2

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the numbers of `nums` are unique.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def find_missing_number(nums):
  """
  Finds the missing number in the range [0, n].

  Args:
    nums: A list of distinct numbers taken from the range [0, n].

  Returns:
    The missing number.
  """

  n = len(nums)
  expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Sum of numbers from 0 to n
  actual_sum = sum(nums)

  return expected_sum - actual_sum


# Example Usage:
nums1 = [3, 0, 1]
print(f"Missing number in {nums1}: {find_missing_number(nums1)}")  # Output: 2

nums2 = [0, 1]
print(f"Missing number in {nums2}: {find_missing_number(nums2)}")  # Output: 2

nums3 = [9, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1]
print(f"Missing number in {nums3}: {find_missing_number(nums3)}")  # Output: 8
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Sum of the Range:** The core idea is to calculate the sum of all numbers that *should* be present in the range `[0, n]`. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.  In Python, we use `//` for integer division to avoid potential float values.

2.  **Sum of the Array:** We calculate the sum of the numbers that are actually present in the `nums` array.

3.  **Difference:** The missing number is simply the difference between the `expected_sum` and the `actual_sum`.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), due to the `sum(nums)` operation.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a few constant extra variables.

**Alternative Solution (Bit Manipulation - XOR):**

```python
def find_missing_number_xor(nums):
  """
  Finds the missing number using XOR operation.

  Args:
    nums: A list of distinct numbers taken from the range [0, n].

  Returns:
    The missing number.
  """

  n = len(nums)
  missing = n

  for i, num in enumerate(nums):
    missing ^= i ^ num

  return missing
```

**Explanation of XOR Solution:**

1.  **XOR Property:**  XOR (exclusive OR) has the following property: `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`.
2.  **XORing the Range and Array:** We initialize `missing` with `n`.  Then, we iterate through the `nums` array, XORing each index `i` with the corresponding number `num` and XORing the result with `missing`.
3.  **Cancellation:** In effect, we are XORing all the numbers from `0` to `n` with all the numbers in the array. Since all numbers except the missing number are present twice (once as an index and once as a value), they cancel each other out due to `a ^ a = 0`.
4.  **The Missing Number Remains:** The missing number, being present only once (as either an index or a value), remains in the `missing` variable.

**Time and Space Complexity of XOR Solution:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n)
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1)

The XOR solution is often preferred because it can be slightly faster in practice and avoids potential integer overflow issues that might arise with very large values of `n` in the sum-based solution. Both solutions, however, are valid and efficient.
