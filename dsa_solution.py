Okay, here's a problem that involves a combination of data structures and algorithmic thinking:

**Problem:**

**Largest Rectangle in Histogram**

Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar heights where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

**Example:**

```
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 5 * 2 = 10.
```

**Explanation/Approach:**

The key idea is to use a stack to keep track of the indices of bars that are potentially part of a larger rectangle. We iterate through the heights array. If the current bar is taller than the bar at the top of the stack, we push the current bar's index onto the stack. If the current bar is shorter than the bar at the top of the stack, we pop bars from the stack until we find a bar that is shorter or equal to the current bar. When we pop a bar, we calculate the area of the rectangle with that bar as the shortest bar. The width of the rectangle is determined by the distance between the current index and the index of the bar on the stack (if the stack is not empty) or the current index itself (if the stack is empty).

**Python Code Solution:**

```python
def largestRectangleArea(heights):
    """
    Finds the area of the largest rectangle in a histogram.

    Args:
        heights: A list of integers representing the histogram's bar heights.

    Returns:
        The area of the largest rectangle.
    """

    stack = []  # Store indices of bars
    max_area = 0
    n = len(heights)

    for i in range(n):
        while stack and heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]:
            height = heights[stack.pop()]
            width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
            max_area = max(max_area, height * width)

        stack.append(i)

    # Process remaining bars in the stack
    while stack:
        height = heights[stack.pop()]
        width = n if not stack else n - stack[-1] - 1
        max_area = max(max_area, height * width)

    return max_area

# Example Usage:
heights = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]
result = largestRectangleArea(heights)
print(f"Largest Rectangle Area: {result}")  # Output: Largest Rectangle Area: 10

heights2 = [2,4]
result2 = largestRectangleArea(heights2)
print(f"Largest Rectangle Area: {result2}") # Output: Largest Rectangle Area: 4

heights3 = [4,2,0,3,2,4,3,4]
result3 = largestRectangleArea(heights3)
print(f"Largest Rectangle Area: {result3}") # Output: Largest Rectangle Area: 10

heights4 = [0,9,8,9,5,9,2,3,2,3]
result4 = largestRectangleArea(heights4)
print(f"Largest Rectangle Area: {result4}") #Output: Largest Rectangle Area: 20
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `stack`: An empty list to store indices of bars.
    *   `max_area`: Initialized to 0 to store the maximum area found so far.
    *   `n`: The number of bars in the histogram.

2.  **Iterating Through the Histogram:**
    *   The code iterates through the `heights` array from left to right.
    *   **`while stack and heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]`:** This is the core logic.  It checks if the stack is not empty *and* the height of the current bar (`heights[i]`) is less than the height of the bar at the top of the stack (`heights[stack[-1]]`). If both conditions are true, it means we've found a bar that's shorter than the bar at the top of the stack, so the rectangle extending from the top of the stack cannot extend to the current bar. Therefore, we need to pop the top bar from the stack and calculate its maximum possible area.
    *   **`height = heights[stack.pop()]`:**  Pop the index of the top bar from the stack and retrieve its height.
    *   **`width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1`:** Calculate the width of the rectangle.
        *   If the stack is now empty after popping, it means the popped bar was the shortest bar from the beginning to the current index `i`. So, the width is `i`.
        *   If the stack is *not* empty, it means there's a bar to the left of the popped bar. The width is the distance between the current index `i` and the index of the bar at the top of the stack (`stack[-1]`) minus 1.  This gives us the width of the rectangle where the popped bar is the shortest.
    *   **`max_area = max(max_area, height * width)`:** Update `max_area` with the larger of the current `max_area` and the calculated area.
    *   **`stack.append(i)`:** After the `while` loop, the current bar's index is pushed onto the stack. This is because it's either taller than the bar at the top of the stack or the stack is empty (meaning it could potentially be part of a larger rectangle later).

3.  **Processing Remaining Bars in the Stack:**
    *   After the main loop finishes, there might still be bars remaining in the stack. This means that these bars could be part of a larger rectangle that extends to the end of the histogram.
    *   The `while stack:` loop processes the remaining bars in the stack in a similar way as before. The only difference is that the width is calculated differently:
        *   `width = n if not stack else n - stack[-1] - 1`
        *   If the stack is empty, it means the popped bar was the shortest bar in the entire histogram, so the width is `n` (the entire width of the histogram).
        *   If the stack is not empty, the width is the distance between the end of the histogram (`n`) and the index of the bar at the top of the stack (`stack[-1]`) minus 1.
    *   `max_area = max(max_area, height * width)`: Updates the maximum area.

4.  **Return `max_area`:**  The function returns the final calculated maximum area.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of bars.  Each bar is pushed onto and popped from the stack at most once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, when the stack might contain all the bars. This happens if the heights are sorted in ascending order.
