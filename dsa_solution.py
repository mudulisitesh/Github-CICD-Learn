Okay, here's a DSA problem with a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists `lists`, where each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == lists.length`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other): # for use in heapq
        return self.val < other.val
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: list[ListNode]) -> ListNode:
        """
        Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

        Args:
            lists: A list of ListNode objects, where each ListNode represents the head of a sorted linked list.

        Returns:
            A ListNode object representing the head of the merged sorted linked list.
            Returns None if the input list is empty or contains only empty lists.
        """

        heap = []
        # Push the head nodes of each list into the heap
        for node in lists:
            if node:
                heapq.heappush(heap, node)  # Push node, priority based on node.val

        dummy = ListNode()  # Dummy node for the merged list
        current = dummy

        while heap:
            node = heapq.heappop(heap)  # Get the node with the smallest value
            current.next = node
            current = current.next

            if node.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap, node.next) # Push the next node of this list

        return dummy.next
# Example usage (assuming you have linked list creation functions)
def create_linked_list(arr):
    if not arr:
        return None
    head = ListNode(arr[0])
    curr = head
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        curr.next = ListNode(arr[i])
        curr = curr.next
    return head

def linked_list_to_array(head):
    arr = []
    curr = head
    while curr:
        arr.append(curr.val)
        curr = curr.next
    return arr

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example usage
    list1 = create_linked_list([1, 4, 5])
    list2 = create_linked_list([1, 3, 4])
    list3 = create_linked_list([2, 6])

    lists = [list1, list2, list3]

    sol = Solution()
    merged_list_head = sol.mergeKLists(lists)
    merged_list_array = linked_list_to_array(merged_list_head)
    print(merged_list_array) # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]

    list4 = create_linked_list([])
    list5 = create_linked_list([1])
    lists2 = [list4, list5]

    merged_list_head2 = sol.mergeKLists(lists2)
    merged_list_array2 = linked_list_to_array(merged_list_head2)
    print(merged_list_array2)  #Output: [1]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **ListNode Class:** Defines the structure of a node in the linked list.  Critically, it implements the `__lt__` method, which is what allows `heapq` to compare the `ListNode` objects directly based on their `val` attribute.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   Creates an empty `heap` (min-heap) to store ListNode objects.
        *   `dummy`: A dummy node used to build the merged list.  It simplifies the logic of adding the first node to the merged list.
        *   `current`: A pointer to the current tail of the merged list.
    *   **Heap Population:** Iterates through the input `lists`. If a list is not empty (i.e., its head is not `None`), the head node of the list is pushed onto the `heap`.  `heapq` maintains the min-heap property based on the `val` of the `ListNode` due to the implemented `__lt__` method.
    *   **Merging:**  While the heap is not empty:
        *   `heapq.heappop(heap)`: Retrieves and removes the node with the smallest `val` from the heap.  This is the next node to be added to the merged list.
        *   The extracted node is appended to the `current.next` of the merged list.
        *   `current` is advanced to the newly added node.
        *   If the extracted node has a `next` node (i.e., there are more nodes in that list), the `next` node is pushed onto the heap.
    *   **Return:** Finally, the `dummy.next` is returned, which is the head of the merged sorted linked list.

3.  **`create_linked_list(arr)` and `linked_list_to_array(head)` Functions**:
    *   These functions are helper functions used to create the sample linked lists used in the example and to convert the list back to array for printing. They are not part of the core algorithm but are useful for testing and demonstrating the solution.

**Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes across all k linked lists, and k is the number of linked lists.  Pushing and popping from the heap takes O(log k) time, and this is done N times (once for each node).

**Space Complexity:** O(k).  The space complexity is dominated by the heap, which stores at most k nodes at any time (one node from each of the input lists).

Key improvements and explanations compared to simpler solutions:

*   **Heap-Based Approach:**  Using a min-heap is the most efficient way to solve this problem.  It ensures that you always pick the smallest available node from all the k lists.  Other approaches like iteratively merging pairs of lists would be less efficient.

*   **`__lt__` Implementation:**  The `__lt__` method is essential for making the ListNode objects comparable within the heap.  Without it, `heapq` would not know how to prioritize the nodes.

*   **Dummy Node:** The dummy node simplifies the merging logic, especially when dealing with an empty list or an empty merged list initially.

*   **Clear Variable Names and Comments:**  The code is well-commented and uses descriptive variable names, making it easier to understand.

*   **Handles Empty Lists:** The code explicitly handles cases where input lists are empty, preventing errors.

*   **Complete, Runnable Example:**  The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block provides a complete, runnable example with helper functions to create and print linked lists, which makes testing and understanding the solution easier.

This comprehensive solution provides a robust and efficient way to merge k sorted linked lists in Python.  It also demonstrates important principles of using heaps for sorting and merging problems.
