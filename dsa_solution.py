Okay, here's a DSA problem (a classic, actually) and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge Intervals**

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example:**

Input: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

Explanation: Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,6]`.

Input: `[[1,4],[4,5]]`
Output: `[[1,5]]`

Explanation: Intervals `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two integers [start, end].

    Returns:
        A list of merged intervals.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals by their start times
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged_intervals = []
    current_interval = intervals[0]  # Initialize with the first interval

    for interval in intervals[1:]:
        # Check for overlap
        if interval[0] <= current_interval[1]:  # Overlap exists
            # Update the end of the current interval if the new interval extends further
            current_interval[1] = max(current_interval[1], interval[1])
        else:
            # No overlap, add the current interval to the result and start a new current interval
            merged_intervals.append(current_interval)
            current_interval = interval

    # Add the last current interval to the result
    merged_intervals.append(current_interval)

    return merged_intervals

# Example Usage:
intervals1 = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
result1 = merge_intervals(intervals1)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals1}: {result1}")  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
result2 = merge_intervals(intervals2)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals2}: {result2}")  # Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
result3 = merge_intervals(intervals3)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals3}: {result3}")  # Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
result4 = merge_intervals(intervals4)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals4}: {result4}") # Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Handle Empty Input:** The function first checks if the input list of intervals is empty. If it is, it returns an empty list.

2. **Sort Intervals:** The intervals are sorted based on their starting times.  This is crucial for the algorithm's efficiency because it allows us to process intervals in a left-to-right manner, easily detecting overlaps.  The `sort()` method with a `lambda` function is used to define a custom sorting key based on the first element (start time) of each interval.

3. **Iterate and Merge:**
   - `merged_intervals`: This list stores the resulting merged intervals.
   - `current_interval`: This variable keeps track of the interval we're currently building/merging.  It is initialized with the first interval after sorting.
   - The code then iterates through the remaining intervals (starting from the second interval).  For each `interval`:
     - **Overlap Check:** It checks if the current `interval` overlaps with the `current_interval`. Overlap occurs if the starting time of the `interval` is less than or equal to the ending time of the `current_interval`.
     - **Merge (if overlap):** If there's overlap, the `current_interval`'s ending time is updated to be the maximum of its current ending time and the ending time of the overlapping `interval`. This ensures that the merged interval covers the entire range.
     - **No Overlap:** If there's no overlap, the current `current_interval` is added to the `merged_intervals` list, and the `current_interval` is updated to the current `interval`.

4. **Add the Last Interval:** After the loop finishes, the last `current_interval` (which might not have been added yet) is added to the `merged_intervals` list.

5. **Return:** The function returns the `merged_intervals` list, which contains the merged intervals.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals. The dominant operation is the sorting of the intervals, which takes O(n log n) time. The iteration and merging process takes O(n) time, but it's overshadowed by the sorting.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of intervals. This is because, in the worst case (no overlapping intervals), the `merged_intervals` list will contain all the original intervals. In-place sorting is possible but depends on the sorting algorithm implementation. In general, we can assume O(n) due to the creation of the merged_intervals list.
