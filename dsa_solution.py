Okay, here's a problem and a Python solution.  Let's make it a reasonably practical one.

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == lists.length`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of k sorted linked lists.

    Returns:
        The head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    heap = []  # Min-heap to store the head nodes of the lists
    for i in range(len(lists)):
        if lists[i]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i, lists[i]))  # (val, list_index, node)

    dummy = ListNode(0)  # Dummy node to simplify the merging process
    curr = dummy

    while heap:
        val, list_index, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        curr.next = node
        curr = curr.next

        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, list_index, node.next))

    return dummy.next

# Example Usage (create linked lists and test):
def create_linked_list(arr):
    """Helper function to create a linked list from an array."""
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    curr = dummy
    for val in arr:
        curr.next = ListNode(val)
        curr = curr.next
    return dummy.next

# Create some sample linked lists
list1 = create_linked_list([1, 4, 5])
list2 = create_linked_list([1, 3, 4])
list3 = create_linked_list([2, 6])

lists = [list1, list2, list3]

# Merge the lists
merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

# Print the merged list (for verification)
def print_linked_list(head):
    """Helper function to print a linked list."""
    result = []
    while head:
        result.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    print(result)

print_linked_list(merged_list)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ListNode` Class:** Defines the structure of a node in the linked list, with a `val` (value) and a `next` pointer.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `heap`: A min-heap is used to efficiently track the smallest elements across all linked lists. We store tuples in the heap: `(value, list_index, node)`. `list_index` is necessary because if two nodes have the same value, the heapq breaks ties lexicographically using the other elements of the tuple.  Without the `list_index`, heapq would try to compare the `ListNode` objects directly, which is not supported by default.  This prevents errors during heap operations.
        *   `dummy`: A dummy node is created to simplify the insertion of the merged list.  We'll return `dummy.next` which will be the head of the actual merged list.
        *   `curr`:  A pointer to the current node in the merged list. It starts at the dummy node.

    *   **Heap Initialization:**
        *   Iterates through the `lists` array.  If a linked list is not empty (i.e., `lists[i]` is not `None`), its head node is added to the min-heap.

    *   **Merging Loop:**
        *   The `while heap:` loop continues as long as there are nodes in the heap.
        *   `heapq.heappop(heap)`: Retrieves and removes the smallest element (node) from the heap. This is the node with the smallest value across all the lists.
        *   `curr.next = node`: The extracted node is appended to the merged list (pointed to by `curr`).
        *   `curr = curr.next`: The `curr` pointer is moved to the newly added node.
        *   `if node.next:`: If the extracted node has a next node in its original list, that next node is added to the heap to be considered for merging.

    *   **Return:**
        *   `dummy.next`:  Returns the head of the merged sorted linked list.

3.  **Helper Functions:**
    *   `create_linked_list(arr)`: Creates a linked list from an array for testing purposes.
    *   `print_linked_list(head)`: Prints the contents of a linked list to the console for verification.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Linked Lists:** Understanding how linked lists are structured and how to traverse them.
*   **Min-Heap:**  A data structure that efficiently finds the smallest element among a set of elements. The `heapq` module in Python provides a convenient implementation of a min-heap.
*   **Priority Queue:** A min-heap is a common way to implement a priority queue, where elements are retrieved based on their priority (in this case, the value of the node).
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes across all linked lists, and k is the number of linked lists.  Heap operations (push and pop) take O(log k) time, and they are performed at most N times.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(k).  The heap holds at most one node from each of the k lists at any given time.  The space used by the output list is O(N), but the problem explicitly requests the *merged* list, so we consider it part of the required output rather than auxiliary space.
