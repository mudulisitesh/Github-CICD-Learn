Okay, here's a randomly generated DSA problem and a working Python solution.

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Linked Lists**

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists, each sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == lists.length`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other): # Necessary for heapq to compare ListNode objects
        return self.val < other.val

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of ListNode objects, where each ListNode represents the head of a sorted linked list.

    Returns:
        The head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    heap = []
    for node in lists:
        if node:
            heapq.heappush(heap, node)  # Push initial heads into the heap

    dummy = ListNode(0)  # Dummy node to simplify the merging process
    tail = dummy

    while heap:
        smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)  # Get the node with the smallest value
        tail.next = smallest           # Append it to the merged list
        tail = tail.next

        if smallest.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest.next) # If there's more in that list, push the next node onto the heap

    return dummy.next  # Return the merged list (excluding the dummy node)

# Example Usage (for testing):
def create_linked_list(arr):
    """Helper function to create a linked list from an array."""
    if not arr:
        return None
    head = ListNode(arr[0])
    curr = head
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        curr.next = ListNode(arr[i])
        curr = curr.next
    return head

def linked_list_to_array(head):
    """Helper function to convert a linked list to an array."""
    result = []
    curr = head
    while curr:
        result.append(curr.val)
        curr = curr.next
    return result

# Example input
list1 = create_linked_list([1, 4, 5])
list2 = create_linked_list([1, 3, 4])
list3 = create_linked_list([2, 6])

lists = [list1, list2, list3]

# Merge the lists
merged_list_head = mergeKLists(lists)

# Convert the merged list to an array for easy printing
merged_list_array = linked_list_to_array(merged_list_head)
print(merged_list_array)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]

# Example with empty list:
empty_list = []
merged_list_head = mergeKLists(empty_list) #handles when empty_list is empty list
merged_list_array = linked_list_to_array(merged_list_head)
print(merged_list_array) #Output: []

# Example with empty linked list(s):
list4 = create_linked_list([])
list5 = create_linked_list([1,2,3])
lists2 = [list4, list5]

merged_list_head2 = mergeKLists(lists2)
merged_list_array2 = linked_list_to_array(merged_list_head2)
print(merged_list_array2) #Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **ListNode Class:** Defines the structure of a node in the linked list, with `val` (the node's value) and `next` (a pointer to the next node).  The `__lt__` method is crucial for comparing `ListNode` objects in the min-heap.  It defines that a `ListNode` is "less than" another `ListNode` if its `val` is smaller.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `heap`: A min-heap to store the heads of the linked lists.  We use `heapq`, Python's built-in heap implementation.
        *   `dummy`: A dummy node is created to simplify the construction of the merged linked list.  It will be discarded at the end.
        *   `tail`: A pointer to the current tail of the merged list.
    *   **Populating the Heap:**
        *   The code iterates through the `lists` array.  For each linked list, it pushes the head node onto the `heap`.  The `heapq` module maintains the heap property, so the smallest node is always at the top.  The `if node:` condition ensures we only push non-empty lists.
    *   **Merging:**
        *   The `while heap` loop continues as long as the heap is not empty.
        *   `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)`: Removes the node with the smallest value from the heap.
        *   `tail.next = smallest`: Appends the `smallest` node to the merged list.
        *   `tail = tail.next`: Moves the `tail` pointer to the newly appended node.
        *   `if smallest.next:`: If the `smallest` node has a `next` node (i.e., there are more nodes in that particular linked list), push the `smallest.next` node onto the heap to be considered in the next iteration.
    *   **Return:**
        *   `return dummy.next`: Returns the head of the merged linked list (skipping the dummy node).

3. **Helper Functions:** `create_linked_list` converts an array to a linked list, and `linked_list_to_array` converts a linked list back to an array to help with testing and visualization of the results.

**Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes across all linked lists, and k is the number of linked lists. Inserting/deleting an element from a heap of size `k` takes O(log k) time, and we do this for all N nodes.

**Space Complexity:** O(k).  The heap stores at most `k` nodes (the heads of the linked lists). The space for the new linked list is O(N), however, the problem specifically asks for the head of the new list as an output, which means that memory has to be allocated to create this list no matter what. Therefore O(k) is the more relevant space complexity.
This solution efficiently merges the K sorted lists using a min-heap, which allows us to always pick the smallest element from all the lists in logarithmic time. The use of a dummy node simplifies the merging logic. The helper functions make the code easier to test and understand.  The `__lt__` method in the `ListNode` class is crucial for the heap to work correctly with custom objects.
