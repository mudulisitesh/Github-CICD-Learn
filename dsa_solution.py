Okay, here's a problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:  Meeting Rooms II**

Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times `[[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...]` (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1
```

**Explanation:**

The idea is to sort the meetings by start time. Then, use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the end times of the meetings that are currently in progress. For each meeting, check if its start time is greater than or equal to the earliest ending meeting (top of the heap).  If it is, then the current meeting can use the same room.  Otherwise, a new room is needed.

**Python Code:**

```python
import heapq

def min_meeting_rooms(intervals):
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of meeting rooms required.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of lists, where each inner list represents a meeting
                   interval [start, end].

    Returns:
        The minimum number of meeting rooms required.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return 0

    # Sort the meetings by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Use a min-heap to keep track of the end times of meetings in progress
    end_times = []  # Stores end times, acting as a min-heap

    # Iterate through the meetings
    for interval in intervals:
        start_time = interval[0]
        end_time = interval[1]

        # If the earliest ending meeting has already ended,
        # then we can reuse the room.
        if end_times and start_time >= end_times[0]:
            heapq.heappop(end_times)

        # Otherwise, we need a new room.  Add the end time of the current
        # meeting to the heap.
        heapq.heappush(end_times, end_time)

    # The number of rooms needed is the number of meetings currently in progress
    return len(end_times)


# Example usage:
intervals1 = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
print(f"Minimum meeting rooms for {intervals1}: {min_meeting_rooms(intervals1)}")  # Output: 2

intervals2 = [[7, 10], [2, 4]]
print(f"Minimum meeting rooms for {intervals2}: {min_meeting_rooms(intervals2)}")  # Output: 1

intervals3 = [[1,10],[2,7],[3,19],[8,12],[10,20],[11,30]]
print(f"Minimum meeting rooms for {intervals3}: {min_meeting_rooms(intervals3)}") # Output: 4
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`min_meeting_rooms(intervals)`:**
    *   Takes a list of meeting intervals `intervals` as input.
    *   Handles the case where the input list is empty.

2.  **Sorting:**
    *   `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])`: Sorts the intervals in ascending order based on their start times.  This is crucial for the algorithm's correctness.

3.  **Min-Heap (Priority Queue):**
    *   `end_times = []`:  An empty list is initialized to act as a min-heap. `heapq` library functions maintain the heap property.  `end_times` will store the *end* times of the meetings that are currently using rooms. The smallest end time will always be at the top of the heap.
    *   `heapq.heappush(end_times, end_time)`: Adds an element (the end time) to the heap while maintaining the heap property (min-heap).
    *   `heapq.heappop(end_times)`: Removes and returns the smallest element (earliest end time) from the heap, again preserving the heap property.

4.  **Iteration and Room Allocation:**
    *   The code iterates through the sorted meeting intervals.
    *   `if end_times and start_time >= end_times[0]`: This is the key logic.  It checks if there are any meetings already in progress (`end_times` is not empty) and if the current meeting's start time is greater than or equal to the *earliest* ending time (the top of the heap, `end_times[0]`).
        *   If this condition is true, it means that a room is available, and we can reuse it. We "remove" the earliest ending meeting from the heap using `heapq.heappop(end_times)` because the room is now available for the current meeting.
        *   If the condition is false, it means that all currently used rooms are still occupied, so we need to allocate a new room.

5.  **Result:**
    *   `return len(end_times)`: The number of elements remaining in the `end_times` heap represents the number of rooms currently in use, which is the minimum number of rooms required.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N log N), where N is the number of intervals.  Sorting takes O(N log N), and heap operations (push and pop) take O(log N) each, and we perform these operations at most N times.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case.  The `end_times` heap can potentially store all the end times if no meetings overlap.
