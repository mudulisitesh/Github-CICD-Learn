Okay, let's create a problem related to tree traversal.

**Problem:**

**Level Order Traversal with Level-Specific Separators**

Given a binary tree, perform a level order traversal (breadth-first traversal). However, instead of simply printing the nodes, print each level on a separate line, separated by a delimiter.  The delimiter should be:

*   `"/"` for even levels (starting from level 0)
*   `"\\"` for odd levels.

**Example:**

```
      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \   \
  4   5   6

Output:
1
2/3
4\5\6
```

**Explanation:**

*   Level 0: 1 (delimiter not applicable as it's the only element)
*   Level 1: 2 3 (even level, delimiter "/")
*   Level 2: 4 5 6 (odd level, delimiter "\\")

**Python Solution:**

```python
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def level_order_with_separators(root):
    """
    Performs a level order traversal of a binary tree, printing each level on a separate line
    with level-specific separators.

    Args:
        root: The root of the binary tree.
    """
    if not root:
        return

    queue = deque([root])
    level = 0

    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        level_nodes = []

        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level_nodes.append(str(node.val))

            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

        if level % 2 == 0:
            delimiter = "/"
        else:
            delimiter = "\\"

        if len(level_nodes) == 1:  #Special case for root and other single node levels
            print(level_nodes[0])
        else:
            print(delimiter.join(level_nodes))

        level += 1



# Example usage:
# Construct the tree from the problem description
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)
root.right.right = TreeNode(6)

level_order_with_separators(root)
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **TreeNode Class:**  Defines a simple binary tree node with `val`, `left`, and `right` attributes.

2.  **`level_order_with_separators(root)` function:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   Handles the case where the `root` is `None` (empty tree).
        *   Creates a `deque` (double-ended queue) called `queue` to hold the nodes for level order traversal.  We use a deque because it provides efficient `append` and `popleft` operations, which are crucial for breadth-first search.
        *   Initializes `level` to 0 to keep track of the current level.
    *   **Main Loop:**
        *   `while queue:`: Continues as long as there are nodes in the queue.
        *   `level_size = len(queue)`:  Gets the number of nodes in the current level. This is important so we can process only the nodes at the current level before moving to the next.
        *   `level_nodes = []`: A list to store the values of the nodes at the current level as strings.
        *   `for _ in range(level_size):`:  Iterates through the nodes at the current level.
            *   `node = queue.popleft()`: Removes the first node from the queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out).
            *   `level_nodes.append(str(node.val))`:  Adds the node's value (converted to a string) to the `level_nodes` list.
            *   `if node.left: queue.append(node.left)`:  If the node has a left child, add it to the queue.
            *   `if node.right: queue.append(node.right)`: If the node has a right child, add it to the queue.
        *   **Delimiter Logic:**
            *   `if level % 2 == 0: delimiter = "/"`: If the level is even, set the delimiter to "/".
            *   `else: delimiter = "\\"`: Otherwise (level is odd), set the delimiter to "\\".

        *   **Print the Level:**
            *   `if len(level_nodes) == 1`: Handles the case where there's only one node on a level.  We don't want to use the delimiter.
            *   `else: print(delimiter.join(level_nodes))`:  Uses the `join()` method to concatenate the strings in the `level_nodes` list, using the calculated `delimiter` as the separator.  This creates the string to be printed.
        *   `level += 1`:  Increments the level counter.

**How it works (Level Order Traversal):**

The algorithm uses a queue to systematically explore the tree level by level. It starts by adding the root node to the queue.  Then, while the queue is not empty, it processes the nodes at the front of the queue.  For each node, it adds the node's value to the `level_nodes` list and adds its children (if any) to the back of the queue.  This ensures that all nodes at a given level are processed before moving to the next level.

The `level_size` variable is crucial for ensuring that we only process the nodes that are currently at the front of the queue for each level. Without it, we would continue adding children and would not be able to properly delineate levels.

This approach guarantees that we visit nodes in the order they appear in a level-by-level traversal, which is the definition of level order traversal. The separators are then added based on the level parity.
