Okay, here's a DSA problem involving finding the minimum window substring, along with a Python solution that addresses it:

**Problem:**

**Minimum Window Substring**

Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t` in complexity O(n).  If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return the empty string "".

**Example:**

```
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"

Output: "BANC"
```

**Explanation:**

The minimum window substring in `s` containing all characters 'A', 'B', and 'C' is "BANC".

**Python Solution:**

```python
from collections import Counter

def min_window(s, t):
    """
    Finds the minimum window substring in s that contains all characters in t.

    Args:
        s: The input string.
        t: The string containing the characters to find.

    Returns:
        The minimum window substring, or an empty string if no such window exists.
    """

    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    need = Counter(t)  # Frequency of characters in t
    window = {}  # Frequency of characters in current window
    have = 0  # Number of characters in window that satisfy need
    required = len(need)  # Number of unique characters in need

    left = 0
    min_len = float('inf')
    start_index = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        char = s[right]
        window[char] = window.get(char, 0) + 1

        if char in need and window[char] == need[char]:
            have += 1

        while have == required:
            # Shrink the window
            window_len = right - left + 1
            if window_len < min_len:
                min_len = window_len
                start_index = left

            left_char = s[left]
            window[left_char] -= 1
            if left_char in need and window[left_char] < need[left_char]:
                have -= 1

            left += 1

    if min_len == float('inf'):
        return ""

    return s[start_index:start_index + min_len]


# Example usage:
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(f"Minimum window substring: {result}")  # Output: BANC

s = "a"
t = "aa"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(f"Minimum window substring: {result}") #Output: ""

s = "cabwefgewcwaefgcf"
t = "cae"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(f"Minimum window substring: {result}") #Output: "cwae"
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `need`:  A `Counter` (from `collections`) storing the frequencies of characters in string `t`.
    *   `window`: A dictionary storing the frequencies of characters in the current window.
    *   `have`: An integer representing the number of characters in the current `window` that meet the required frequencies in `need`.
    *   `required`: The number of unique characters in `t`. This is `len(need)`.
    *   `left`: The left pointer of the sliding window.
    *   `min_len`: Keeps track of the minimum window length found so far (initialized to infinity).
    *   `start_index`: Stores the starting index of the minimum window.

2.  **Sliding Window:**
    *   The code iterates through the string `s` using a `right` pointer.
    *   For each character `char` at `s[right]`:
        *   Update the `window` frequency.
        *   If `char` is present in `need` and its frequency in `window` now matches its frequency in `need`, increment `have`.
        *   While `have == required`:  This means the current window contains all the characters in `t` with sufficient frequencies.
            *   Shrink the window from the left (`left` pointer).
            *   Calculate the current window length.  If it's smaller than `min_len`, update `min_len` and `start_index`.
            *   Decrement the frequency of the character at `s[left]` in the `window`.
            *   If the frequency of `s[left]` in `window` is now less than its required frequency in `need` (and it's present in `need`), decrement `have`.
            *   Move the `left` pointer to the right.

3.  **Return Result:**
    *   If `min_len` is still infinity, it means no window was found. Return "".
    *   Otherwise, return the substring of `s` starting at `start_index` with length `min_len`.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of string `s`.  We iterate through `s` once with the `right` pointer. The `while` loop for shrinking the window might iterate multiple times, but in total, the `left` pointer also moves a maximum of n times.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(m), where m is the number of unique characters in `t`.  The `need` and `window` dictionaries can store up to m characters. In the worst case, if all the characters in `t` are unique, and `t` is much shorter than `s`, this can be considered effectively O(1) because the number of unique chars is limited.
