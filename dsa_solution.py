Okay, here's a DSA problem and its Python solution:

**Problem:  Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of `k` linked lists, each linked list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked lists into one sorted linked list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == len(lists)`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution (Using a Min-Heap):**

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of k sorted linked lists.

    Returns:
        The head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    heap = []  # Min-heap to store nodes from the linked lists
    for i in range(len(lists)):
        if lists[i]:  # Only add to heap if the list is not empty
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i, lists[i]))  # Tuple: (value, list_index, node)

    dummy = ListNode(-1)  # Dummy node to simplify the merging process
    tail = dummy

    while heap:
        val, list_index, node = heapq.heappop(heap)  # Get the node with the smallest value

        tail.next = node  # Add the node to the merged list
        tail = tail.next

        if node.next:  # If the node has a next node in its list
            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, list_index, node.next))  # Add the next node to the heap

    return dummy.next  # Return the head of the merged list (excluding the dummy node)


# Example usage (create some dummy linked lists):
# List 1: 1->4->5
head1 = ListNode(1)
head1.next = ListNode(4)
head1.next.next = ListNode(5)

# List 2: 1->3->4
head2 = ListNode(1)
head2.next = ListNode(3)
head2.next.next = ListNode(4)

# List 3: 2->6
head3 = ListNode(2)
head3.next = ListNode(6)

lists = [head1, head2, head3]

merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

# Print the merged list
while merged_list:
    print(merged_list.val, end="->")
    merged_list = merged_list.next
print("None")
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ListNode` Class:** Defines the structure of a node in the linked list.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `heap`:  A min-heap (priority queue) is used to efficiently track the smallest node across all `k` lists. We store tuples of the form `(value, list_index, node)` in the heap. `list_index` is included to avoid issues when two nodes have the same value (otherwise, the heap might not know how to compare them reliably.)
        *   `dummy`: A dummy node is used to simplify the merging process. It acts as a placeholder for the head of the merged list.  We start building the result list from `dummy.next`.
        *   `tail`:  A pointer to the last node added to the merged list.

    *   **Building the Heap:**
        *   Iterate through the `lists` array.
        *   For each list, if it's not empty, push the first node (its value, its index in the `lists` array, and the node itself) onto the heap.

    *   **Merging:**
        *   While the heap is not empty:
            *   `heapq.heappop(heap)`:  Extract the node with the smallest value from the heap (along with its list index and the node object).
            *   `tail.next = node`: Append the extracted node to the merged list.
            *   `tail = tail.next`:  Move the `tail` pointer to the newly added node.
            *   `if node.next`: If the extracted node has a `next` node in its original list, push that `next` node (along with its value and list index) onto the heap.

    *   **Return:**  Return `dummy.next`, which is the head of the merged sorted linked list.

**Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all the linked lists, and k is the number of linked lists.

**Space Complexity:** O(k) because the heap will hold at most `k` nodes at any time. (In the worst case, the first node from each of the `k` lists will be in the heap).  We do modify the original linked lists, so the space complexity might depend on the specific requirements of the problem.  If we weren't allowed to modify the original lists, we would need O(N) space to create a new linked list.
**Why this is a good solution:**

*   **Efficiency:**  Using a min-heap allows us to efficiently find the smallest node across all lists at each step.
*   **Clarity:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The comments explain each step.
*   **Correctness:** The code correctly merges the `k` sorted lists into a single sorted list.
*   **Generalization:** This approach works well for a large number of lists and is the generally accepted optimal solution for this problem.
