Okay, here's a DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge Intervals**

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example:**

Input: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
Explanation: Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, merge them into `[1,6]`.

Input: `[[1,4],[4,5]]`
Output: `[[1,5]]`
Explanation: Intervals `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two integers [start, end].

    Returns:
        A list of merged intervals.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals by their start times.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged = []
    current_interval = intervals[0]

    for interval in intervals[1:]:
        # Check for overlap
        if interval[0] <= current_interval[1]:
            # Merge the intervals by updating the end time of the current interval.
            current_interval[1] = max(current_interval[1], interval[1])
        else:
            # No overlap, add the current interval to the merged list and start a new current interval.
            merged.append(current_interval)
            current_interval = interval

    # Add the last current interval to the merged list.
    merged.append(current_interval)

    return merged

# Example Usage
intervals1 = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
print(f"Input: {intervals1}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals1)}")  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
print(f"Input: {intervals2}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals2)}")  # Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1, 3], [5, 8], [2, 4], [6, 10], [20, 25]]
print(f"Input: {intervals3}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals3)}") # Output: [[1, 4], [5, 10], [20, 25]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
print(f"Input: {intervals4}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals4)}") # Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals5 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
print(f"Input: {intervals5}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals5)}") # Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Intervals:**
   - The algorithm first sorts the intervals based on their starting times. This is crucial because it allows us to process intervals in a sequential order and easily check for overlaps.
   - `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` sorts the intervals in place using a lambda function to specify the sorting key (the first element of each interval).

2. **Iterate and Merge:**
   - `merged`: This list will store the final merged intervals.
   - `current_interval`: This variable holds the interval we are currently building/merging.  It's initialized with the first interval in the sorted list.
   - The code then iterates through the remaining intervals, starting from the second one.
   - **Overlap Check:** For each `interval` in the sorted list, it checks if `interval[0]` (the start time of the current interval being considered) is less than or equal to `current_interval[1]` (the end time of the interval we're building). If this condition is true, it means the current interval overlaps with the `current_interval`.
   - **Merge:** If there's an overlap, the `current_interval`'s end time is updated to the maximum of its current end time and the end time of the overlapping interval (`interval[1]`). This effectively merges the two intervals into a single interval that covers both.
   - **No Overlap:** If there's no overlap, it means the current `interval` is completely separate from the `current_interval`.  In this case:
     - The `current_interval` (which is now a complete merged interval) is added to the `merged` list.
     - The `current_interval` is updated to the `interval` we just processed, starting a new interval for merging.

3. **Add the Last Interval:**
   - After the loop finishes, there's one `current_interval` left that hasn't been added to the `merged` list.  This is because the loop only adds `current_interval` when it encounters an interval that *doesn't* overlap.  So, we need to explicitly add it at the end.

4. **Return:** The function returns the `merged` list, which contains the merged intervals.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting of the intervals. The rest of the algorithm takes O(n) time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where there are no overlapping intervals, and we need to store all the intervals in the `merged` list.  The sorting might take O(log n) space depending on the sorting algorithm used by the implementation.  In place sorting could reduce the space complexity.
