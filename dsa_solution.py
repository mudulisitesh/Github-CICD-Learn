Okay, here's a DSA problem and a corresponding Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Longest Increasing Subsequence with a Twist: Circular Array**

Given a circular array (meaning the last element is considered adjacent to the first element), find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The subsequence doesn't have to be contiguous.  In a circular array, you can "wrap around" from the end to the beginning while creating your subsequence.

**Example:**

*   `arr = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`  Longest increasing subsequence: `[1, 2, 4, 5]` - Length 4
*   `arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`  Longest increasing subsequence: `[5]` or `[4]` or `[3]` or `[2]` or `[1]` - Length 1
*   `arr = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`  Longest increasing subsequence: `[3, 4, 5]` or `[1, 2]` (Wrap-around: [1,2,3,4,5]) or [3,4,5,1,2]` - Length 5

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `len(arr)` <= 1000
*   -10^4 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^4

**Python Solution:**

```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence_circular(arr):
    """
    Finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a circular array.

    Args:
        arr: The input circular array (list of integers).

    Returns:
        The length of the longest increasing subsequence.
    """
    n = len(arr)

    if n == 0:
        return 0

    if n == 1:
        return 1

    # Standard LIS using Patience Sorting (tails array)
    def lis(nums):
        tails = []  # Tails of increasing subsequences (smallest tail values)

        for num in nums:
            if not tails or num > tails[-1]:
                tails.append(num)
            else:
                # Binary search to find the smallest tail >= num
                l, r = 0, len(tails) - 1
                while l <= r:
                    mid = (l + r) // 2
                    if tails[mid] < num:
                        l = mid + 1
                    else:
                        r = mid - 1
                tails[l] = num  # Replace the smallest tail >= num with num
        return len(tails)

    # Case 1: No wrap-around needed.  Just standard LIS.
    max_len = lis(arr)

    # Case 2: Wrap-around possible.  Try all starting points
    # (effectively consider every possible starting index)

    for start in range(1, n):
        # Construct a rotated array starting from 'start'
        rotated_arr = arr[start:] + arr[:start]

        max_len = max(max_len, lis(rotated_arr))  # Update the max LIS length

    return max_len


# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]
arr2 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
arr3 = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
arr4 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr5 = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
arr6 = [4,5,6,7,1,2,3]


print(f"LIS for {arr1}: {longest_increasing_subsequence_circular(arr1)}")  # Output: 4
print(f"LIS for {arr2}: {longest_increasing_subsequence_circular(arr2)}")  # Output: 1
print(f"LIS for {arr3}: {longest_increasing_subsequence_circular(arr3)}")  # Output: 5
print(f"LIS for {arr4}: {longest_increasing_subsequence_circular(arr4)}")  # Output: 5
print(f"LIS for {arr5}: {longest_increasing_subsequence_circular(arr5)}")  # Output: 5
print(f"LIS for {arr6}: {longest_increasing_subsequence_circular(arr6)}")  # Output: 7
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`longest_increasing_subsequence_circular(arr)` Function:**
    *   Handles edge cases of empty and single-element arrays.
    *   It calls the `lis()` function (standard Longest Increasing Subsequence) to find the LIS without considering the circular property. This is our base case (Case 1).
    *   Iterates through all possible starting indices in the array using a `for` loop.  For each possible starting index `start`, it creates a `rotated_arr` which is a version of the array where elements after `start` come first, followed by elements before `start`. This effectively simulates starting the array from the `start` index.
    *   For each `rotated_arr`, the `lis()` function is called again to find the LIS in that rotated version.
    *   The `max()` function keeps track of the maximum LIS length seen so far across all starting positions.
    *   Finally, it returns the maximum LIS length.

2.  **`lis(nums)` Function (Standard Longest Increasing Subsequence):**
    *   Uses the "Patience Sorting" technique (which is a variation of dynamic programming and binary search) to find the LIS.
    *   `tails` array:  `tails[i]` stores the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of length `i+1`.
    *   The key idea is that when you encounter a new element `num`, you try to extend an existing subsequence or start a new one.
        *   If `num` is greater than the largest tail in `tails`, it extends the longest subsequence, so you append `num` to `tails`.
        *   If `num` is not greater than the largest tail, it can potentially replace a tail in `tails` to create a smaller tail value. This is where the binary search is used. We find the smallest tail value that is greater than or equal to `num`, and replace that tail value with `num`.  This ensures that the tails array always remains sorted and that we're keeping track of the smallest possible tail values for subsequences of different lengths.
    *   The length of the `tails` array at the end is the length of the LIS.

**Time Complexity:**

*   `lis(nums)`: O(n log n) because of the binary search within the loop.
*   `longest_increasing_subsequence_circular()`: O(n * (n log n))  = O(n<sup>2</sup> log n) because it calls `lis()` `n` times.

**Space Complexity:**

*   `lis(nums)`: O(n) for the `tails` array in the worst case (when the array is increasing).
*   `longest_increasing_subsequence_circular()`: O(n) because of the `rotated_arr` and the space used by `lis()`.  The space usage of rotated_arr can be optimized, but the overall space complexity remains O(n) because of the `tails` array in the `lis()` function.

**Key Ideas:**

*   **Circular Array Handling:** The core idea is to try all possible starting points in the array. This is done by creating `rotated_arr` versions of the array.
*   **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):** The standard LIS algorithm (Patience Sorting) is used as a building block.  Understanding this algorithm is essential.
*   **Patience Sorting (Binary Search):** Using binary search within the LIS algorithm is what provides the efficient O(n log n) time complexity for finding the LIS of a single array.

This problem is a good exercise in combining a standard algorithm (LIS) with a problem-specific constraint (circular array).  The circular array is handled by systematically considering all possible starting points.
