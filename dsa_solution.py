Okay, here's a DSA problem and a Python solution, focusing on a common and useful concept:

**Problem:  Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation:
The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq  # For priority queue

class ListNode:  # Definition for singly-linked list.
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def merge_k_lists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of ListNode objects, each representing a sorted linked list.

    Returns:
        A ListNode object representing the head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    # Create a min-heap (priority queue) to store the head nodes of the lists.
    heap = []
    for i in range(len(lists)):
        if lists[i]:  # Important:  Check for empty lists
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i, lists[i])) # (value, list_index, node)

    # Create a dummy head for the merged list
    dummy_head = ListNode()
    current = dummy_head

    while heap:
        val, list_index, node = heapq.heappop(heap) # Get the smallest element
        current.next = node  # Append the node to the merged list
        current = current.next

        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, list_index, node.next)) # Add the next node from that list

    return dummy_head.next

# Example Usage (Create sample linked lists)
def create_linked_list(arr):
    """Helper function to create a linked list from an array."""
    dummy_head = ListNode()
    current = dummy_head
    for val in arr:
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
    return dummy_head.next

# Create the sample lists
list1 = create_linked_list([1, 4, 5])
list2 = create_linked_list([1, 3, 4])
list3 = create_linked_list([2, 6])

lists = [list1, list2, list3]

# Merge the lists
merged_list = merge_k_lists(lists)

# Print the merged list (for verification)
def print_linked_list(head):
    """Helper function to print a linked list."""
    result = []
    while head:
        result.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    print(result)

print_linked_list(merged_list) # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ListNode` Class:**  Defines the structure of a node in a singly-linked list.  Includes `val` (the node's value) and `next` (a pointer to the next node).

2. **`merge_k_lists(lists)` Function:**
   - **Min-Heap (Priority Queue):** Uses `heapq` (Python's built-in heap implementation) as a min-heap.  A min-heap ensures that the element with the smallest value is always at the top.
   - **Initialization:**
     - Iterates through the input `lists` (the array of linked lists).
     - **Crucial Check:** `if lists[i]` checks if a list is *not* empty before adding its head node to the heap.  This prevents errors when encountering empty lists.
     - `heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i, lists[i]))`:  Adds a tuple to the heap.  The tuple contains:
       - `lists[i].val`: The value of the node (used for comparison in the heap).
       - `i`: The *index* of the list the node came from. This is important for breaking ties when two nodes have the same value, and to know from which list to retrieve the next node.
       - `lists[i]`:  The actual `ListNode` object.
   - **Merging Loop:**
     - `dummy_head`: Creates a dummy head node.  This simplifies the code by providing a consistent starting point for building the merged list.  The `current` pointer is initialized to the dummy head.
     - `while heap:`: Continues as long as there are nodes in the heap.
     - `val, list_index, node = heapq.heappop(heap)`:  Retrieves the node with the smallest value from the heap.  `heapq.heappop()` removes and returns the smallest element.
     - `current.next = node`: Appends the retrieved node to the merged list.
     - `current = current.next`: Moves the `current` pointer to the newly appended node.
     - `if node.next:`: Checks if the node that was just added has a `next` node (i.e., if there are more nodes in the original linked list from which this node came).
     - `heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, list_index, node.next))`: If there is a `next` node, add it to the heap, so it can be considered in the merging process.  Note that we keep the original `list_index` so the algorithm knows which list it came from.
   - **Return Value:** `dummy_head.next` returns the head of the merged list (skipping the dummy head node).

3. **Helper Functions (`create_linked_list`, `print_linked_list`):**  These functions are provided to help with creating sample linked lists for testing and printing the results.

**Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all the linked lists and k is the number of linked lists.

**Space Complexity:** O(k) because the priority queue (heap) holds at most k elements at any given time (one node from each list). The space used to create the linked list for the output is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in all lists.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Linked Lists:** Understanding linked list data structures.
* **Priority Queue (Heap):**  Using a min-heap to efficiently find the smallest element among the heads of the k lists.
* **Divide and Conquer (Implicit):** The heap effectively manages the merging process in a way that prioritizes the smallest elements, ensuring the sorted order.
* **Dummy Nodes:**  Using a dummy node simplifies list manipulation.
* **Tuples for Heap:** Using tuples in the heap to store the value, the original list index, and the node itself is crucial for maintaining the correct state.

This solution is efficient and widely used for the "Merge K Sorted Lists" problem.  Remember to understand the underlying concepts to apply them to other similar problems.
