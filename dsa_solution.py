Okay, here's a DSA problem, along with a Python solution.

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == lists.length`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.val < other.val  # Needed for heapq


def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of ListNode objects, where each ListNode is the head
               of a sorted linked list.

    Returns:
        The head of the merged sorted linked list, or None if the input list
        is empty or contains only empty lists.
    """

    heap = []
    # Push the head nodes of all lists into the min-heap
    for head in lists:
        if head:
            heapq.heappush(heap, head)

    # Create a dummy node to start the merged list
    dummy = ListNode()
    current = dummy  # Pointer to build the merged list

    while heap:
        # Get the smallest node from the heap
        smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)

        # Add the smallest node to the merged list
        current.next = smallest
        current = current.next

        # Add the next node from the list of the smallest node
        if smallest.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest.next)

    return dummy.next # Return the merged list, skipping the dummy node



# Example Usage and Testing
def create_linked_list(arr):
    """Helper function to create a linked list from an array."""
    if not arr:
        return None
    head = ListNode(arr[0])
    current = head
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        current.next = ListNode(arr[i])
        current = current.next
    return head


def linked_list_to_list(head):
    """Helper function to convert a linked list to a Python list."""
    result = []
    current = head
    while current:
        result.append(current.val)
        current = current.next
    return result



# Example Usage:
list1 = create_linked_list([1, 4, 5])
list2 = create_linked_list([1, 3, 4])
list3 = create_linked_list([2, 6])

lists = [list1, list2, list3]
merged_list_head = mergeKLists(lists)
merged_list = linked_list_to_list(merged_list_head)
print(merged_list)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]

list4 = create_linked_list([])
list5 = create_linked_list([1])
list6 = create_linked_list([])

lists2 = [list4,list5,list6]
merged_list_head2 = mergeKLists(lists2)
merged_list2 = linked_list_to_list(merged_list_head2)
print(merged_list2) # Output: [1]

list7 = create_linked_list([])
lists3 = [list7]
merged_list_head3 = mergeKLists(lists3)
merged_list3 = linked_list_to_list(merged_list_head3)
print(merged_list3)  # Output: []
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ListNode` Class:** Defines the structure of a node in the linked list, containing a `val` (value) and a `next` pointer.  The `__lt__` method is crucial.  It enables the comparison of `ListNode` objects, based on their `val` attribute. This is required for the min-heap implementation to correctly determine the smallest node.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**

    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `heap`:  A min-heap (using `heapq`) to store the head nodes of the input linked lists.  The min-heap efficiently keeps track of the smallest node among the heads.
        *   `dummy`:  A dummy node is created to simplify the process of building the merged linked list.  It allows us to easily add nodes to the beginning of the result without worrying about special cases for the first node.
        *   `current`:  A pointer to the last node added to the merged list.  It's initialized to the dummy node.

    *   **Populating the Heap:** The code iterates through the input `lists`. For each linked list, if it's not empty (i.e., `head` is not `None`), the head node is pushed onto the `heap`.

    *   **Merging Process:** The `while heap` loop continues as long as there are nodes in the heap:
        *   `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)`:  The node with the smallest value is extracted from the heap.
        *   `current.next = smallest`:  The `smallest` node is added to the merged list by attaching it to the `current` node.
        *   `current = current.next`:  The `current` pointer is moved to the newly added node.
        *   `if smallest.next:`:  If the `smallest` node has a `next` node in its original linked list, that `next` node is pushed onto the heap so it can be considered for merging later.

    *   **Returning the Merged List:**  Finally, the function returns `dummy.next`.  This skips the dummy node, returning the actual head of the merged sorted list.

3.  **Helper Functions:**  `create_linked_list` and `linked_list_to_list` are helper functions to make testing and visualizing the results easier.

**Key Concepts Used:**

*   **Linked Lists:**  A fundamental data structure where elements are stored in nodes, with each node pointing to the next.
*   **Min-Heap:** A heap-based priority queue that allows efficient retrieval of the smallest element.  The `heapq` module in Python provides an implementation of a min-heap.  Crucially, the comparison behavior of the `ListNode` objects is defined using `__lt__`, enabling the min-heap to work correctly.
*   **Priority Queue:** An abstract data type that allows you to insert elements with associated priorities and efficiently retrieve the element with the highest (or lowest) priority. In this case, it's used to maintain the order of the linked list nodes based on their values.
*   **Divide and Conquer (Implicitly):** The problem could be solved with divide and conquer, recursively merging two lists at a time. However, the heap approach often provides better practical performance for a larger number of lists.
*   **Dummy Node:** A common technique used in linked list problems to simplify insertion at the head of the list.

**Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all the linked lists and k is the number of linked lists.  Each node is inserted into and removed from the heap once. Heap operations take O(log k) time.

**Space Complexity:** O(k), due to the space used by the min-heap, which can hold at most one node from each of the k lists at any given time.  O(1) additional space (excluding the result linked list), if you don't consider the space used for the output list.  If you include the space for the output list, then O(N) space, where N is the total number of nodes.
