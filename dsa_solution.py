Okay, here's a random DSA problem, along with a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge Overlapping Intervals**

Given a list of intervals represented as pairs of integers `[start, end]`, where `start` is the start time and `end` is the end time of the interval, merge all overlapping intervals and return a list of non-overlapping intervals that cover the same range.

**Example:**

```
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
```

**Explanation:**

The intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,6]`. The other intervals do not overlap with `[1,6]`, or each other.
```
intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
```
The intervals `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,5]`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def merge_overlapping_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals represented as pairs of integers [start, end].

    Returns:
        A list of non-overlapping intervals that cover the same range.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals by their start times.  This is crucial.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Using a lambda function for a concise sort key

    merged_intervals = []
    current_interval = intervals[0]

    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        next_interval = intervals[i]

        # Check for overlap
        if next_interval[0] <= current_interval[1]:
            # Overlap found, merge the intervals
            current_interval[1] = max(current_interval[1], next_interval[1]) # Extend end if next interval extends it further
        else:
            # No overlap, add the current interval to the result and update current_interval
            merged_intervals.append(current_interval)
            current_interval = next_interval

    # Add the last interval to the result
    merged_intervals.append(current_interval)

    return merged_intervals

# Example usage:
intervals1 = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
print(f"Input: {intervals1}, Output: {merge_overlapping_intervals(intervals1)}")  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
print(f"Input: {intervals2}, Output: {merge_overlapping_intervals(intervals2)}") # Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
print(f"Input: {intervals3}, Output: {merge_overlapping_intervals(intervals3)}") # Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
print(f"Input: {intervals4}, Output: {merge_overlapping_intervals(intervals4)}") # Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]

intervals5 = [[1,4],[0,2],[3,5]]
print(f"Input: {intervals5}, Output: {merge_overlapping_intervals(intervals5)}") # Output: [[0, 5]]

intervals6 = [[4,4],[0,0]]
print(f"Input: {intervals6}, Output: {merge_overlapping_intervals(intervals6)}") # Output: [[0, 0], [4, 4]]
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **`merge_overlapping_intervals(intervals)`:**
   - Takes a list of intervals as input.
   - Handles the empty list case.
   - **Sorting:**  The most important step. `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` sorts the intervals based on their start times.  Sorting is crucial for efficiently detecting and merging overlaps. Without sorting, you'd have to compare every interval with every other interval, leading to much higher time complexity.
   - Initializes `merged_intervals` to store the result and `current_interval` with the first interval after sorting.
   - **Iteration:** The code iterates through the rest of the sorted intervals (starting from the second interval).
   - **Overlap Check:**  `if next_interval[0] <= current_interval[1]` checks if the start time of the `next_interval` is less than or equal to the end time of the `current_interval`.  If this is true, it means the intervals overlap.
   - **Merging:** If there's an overlap:
     - `current_interval[1] = max(current_interval[1], next_interval[1])` merges the intervals by updating the end time of the `current_interval` to be the maximum of the current end time and the end time of the `next_interval`. This ensures that the merged interval covers the entire range of both original intervals.
   - **No Overlap:** If there's no overlap:
     - `merged_intervals.append(current_interval)` adds the `current_interval` to the `merged_intervals` list because it doesn't overlap with the `next_interval`.
     - `current_interval = next_interval` updates `current_interval` to be the `next_interval` so we can continue comparing it with the remaining intervals.
   - **Adding the Last Interval:** After the loop finishes, the `current_interval` is still potentially unmerged.  So, `merged_intervals.append(current_interval)` adds the last processed interval to the `merged_intervals`.
   - Returns the `merged_intervals` list.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The rest of the algorithm takes O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case (when there are no overlaps) because the `merged_intervals` list can store all the original intervals.  In the best case (all intervals overlap into a single interval), it's O(1).  But the space complexity is generally considered O(n) because the number of output intervals can be, at most, `n`.

**Key Ideas in this Solution:**

- **Sorting:** Sorting the intervals by start time is the foundation of the algorithm's efficiency.  It allows you to process the intervals in a sequential manner and easily determine overlaps.
- **Greedy Approach:** This solution uses a greedy approach.  It makes the optimal choice at each step (merging overlapping intervals) to achieve the global optimal solution (a list of non-overlapping intervals covering the same range).
- **In-Place Modification (Optional):**  You could potentially modify the input `intervals` list directly to save some space, but this would change the original input, which might not be desirable. The current code creates a new `merged_intervals` list to store the results.
