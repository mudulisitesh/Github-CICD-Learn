Okay, here's a random DSA problem with a Python solution:

**Problem: Merge Intervals**

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example:**

*   **Input:** `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
*   **Output:** `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
    *   Explanation: Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,6]`.

**Another Example:**

*   **Input:** `intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`
*   **Output:** `[[1,5]]`
    *   Explanation: Intervals `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping.

**Python Code Solution:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two integers [start, end].

    Returns:
        A list of merged intervals.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals based on the start time.  Important for efficient merging!
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort by start time

    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the current interval does not overlap with the previous one,
        # append it.
        if not merged or interval[0] > merged[-1][1]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous
            # intervals.  Take the maximum of the end times.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

    return merged

# Example Usage:
intervals1 = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
result1 = merge_intervals(intervals1)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals1}: {result1}")  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
result2 = merge_intervals(intervals2)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals2}: {result2}") # Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1, 4], [0, 4]]
result3 = merge_intervals(intervals3)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals3}: {result3}") # Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
result4 = merge_intervals(intervals4)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals4}: {result4}") # Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Sort Intervals:** The key to solving this efficiently is to sort the intervals by their start times. This allows us to iterate through the intervals in order and easily check for overlaps.

2.  **Iterate and Merge:** We iterate through the sorted intervals, maintaining a `merged` list of intervals.

    *   If the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in `merged` (i.e., the current interval's start time is greater than the last interval's end time), we simply append the current interval to `merged`.

    *   If the current interval *does* overlap, we update the end time of the last interval in `merged` to be the maximum of its current end time and the current interval's end time. This effectively merges the intervals.

3.  **Return Merged Intervals:** Finally, we return the `merged` list, which contains the merged intervals.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals.  This is primarily due to the sorting step.  The iteration to merge the intervals takes O(n) time, but sorting dominates.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where `n` is the number of intervals. This is because in the worst case (no overlaps), the `merged` list will contain all the input intervals.  In some cases, sorting might also take O(n) space if not done in-place.
