Okay, here's a random DSA problem and a corresponding Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Group Anagrams**

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together.  You can return the answer in *any order*.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example:**

```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
*   `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

**Python Solution:**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def group_anagrams(strs):
    """
    Groups anagrams together in a list of strings.

    Args:
        strs: A list of strings.

    Returns:
        A list of lists, where each inner list contains anagrams.
    """

    anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)  # Dictionary to store anagrams

    for s in strs:
        # Create a canonical representation of the string (sorted letters)
        sorted_s = "".join(sorted(s))

        # Add the original string to the corresponding group
        anagram_groups[sorted_s].append(s)

    return list(anagram_groups.values())  # Return the values (lists of anagrams)

# Example usage:
strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
result = group_anagrams(strs)
print(result) # Output: [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']] (or a different order of these inner lists)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`defaultdict(list)`:**  We use a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module.  This is a dictionary-like structure that automatically creates a new list as the default value for a key if the key doesn't already exist.  This avoids `KeyError` exceptions.  We use a list to store the anagrams for each key.

2.  **Iterate through strings:**  The code iterates through each string `s` in the input list `strs`.

3.  **Create Canonical Representation:**
    *   `sorted(s)`: This sorts the characters in the string `s` alphabetically, returning a list of characters.
    *   `"".join(...)`: This joins the sorted characters back into a single string. This sorted string acts as a "canonical" representation of the anagram group.  For example, "eat", "tea", and "ate" will all have the canonical representation "aet".

4.  **Group Anagrams:**
    *   `anagram_groups[sorted_s].append(s)`:  This is where the grouping happens. The sorted string `sorted_s` is used as the key in the `anagram_groups` dictionary.  The original string `s` is appended to the list associated with that key.  If `sorted_s` is a new key, the `defaultdict` creates a new list, and `s` is added to it.

5.  **Return Result:**
    *   `list(anagram_groups.values())`:  Finally, the code returns a list of lists.  `anagram_groups.values()` returns a view of the lists that are the values in the dictionary.  `list(...)` converts this view into a list.  Each inner list contains the anagrams that belong to the same group.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K * log(K)), where N is the number of strings in the input array, and K is the maximum length of a string. The K * log(K) factor comes from sorting each string.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N * K), where N is the number of strings, and K is the maximum length of a string.  This is because, in the worst case, all the strings could be unique, and we would store them all in the `anagram_groups` dictionary.
