Okay, here's a random DSA problem, along with a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Rotate Array**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
*   `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^5`

**Python Solution:**

```python
def rotate(nums, k):
  """
  Rotates an array to the right by k steps.

  Args:
    nums: The array to rotate (in-place).
    k: The number of steps to rotate.
  """

  n = len(nums)
  k = k % n  # Handle cases where k > n

  # Using slicing and concatenation (efficient)
  nums[:] = nums[n-k:] + nums[:n-k]


# Example usage:
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k1 = 3
rotate(nums1, k1)
print(nums1)  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

nums2 = [-1, -100, 3, 99]
k2 = 2
rotate(nums2, k2)
print(nums2)  # Output: [3, 99, -1, -100]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Handle Large `k`:** `k = k % n` ensures that `k` is always within the bounds of the array length.  If `k` is larger than the array length, we only need to rotate by the remainder after dividing `k` by the array length.

2.  **Slicing and Concatenation:** This is the core of the solution.  It's generally the most efficient way to rotate an array in Python.
    *   `nums[n-k:]` extracts the last `k` elements of the array (the part that will be moved to the beginning).
    *   `nums[:n-k]` extracts the first `n-k` elements of the array (the part that will be shifted to the right).
    *   We then concatenate these two slices and assign the result back to `nums[:]`. The `[:]` is critical because it performs an in-place modification of the original `nums` list, as required by the problem statement.

**Why this solution?**

*   **In-place modification:**  The problem often specifies an "in-place" solution, which means you shouldn't create a completely new array to store the rotated result.  This solution modifies the original `nums` list directly.
*   **Efficiency:**  Python's slicing and concatenation are relatively efficient operations (implemented in C underneath).  It's usually faster than manual element-by-element shifting, especially for large arrays.
*   **Readability:**  The code is concise and easy to understand.

**Alternative Approaches (less efficient, but useful for understanding):**

*   **Repeated Shifts:** You could rotate the array by one position `k` times.  This is easy to understand but very inefficient (O(n*k) time complexity).
*   **Using Extra Space (O(n) space):** You could create a new array, copy elements to the correct positions in the new array, and then copy the new array back to the original. This is also less preferred because it doesn't modify the array in-place.
