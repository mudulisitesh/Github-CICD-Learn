Okay, here's a random DSA problem, along with a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Minimum Window Substring**

Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is present in the window.

If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return an empty string "".

If there are multiple minimum window substrings, return the one with the leftmost starting position.

**Example:**

*   `s` = "ADOBECODEBANC", `t` = "ABC"
*   Output: "BANC"

**Explanation:**

The minimum window in `s` which has `A`, `B`, and `C` is "BANC".

**Python Solution:**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def min_window_substring(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    """
    Finds the minimum window substring of s containing all characters in t.

    Args:
        s: The string to search in.
        t: The string containing the characters to find.

    Returns:
        The minimum window substring of s containing all characters in t,
        or an empty string if no such window exists.
    """

    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    need = defaultdict(int)
    for char in t:
        need[char] += 1

    window = defaultdict(int)
    have = 0  # Count of chars in 't' that are satisfied in the window
    required = len(need) # Count of unique chars in 't'

    left = 0
    min_len = float('inf')
    start_index = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        char = s[right]
        window[char] += 1

        if char in need and window[char] == need[char]:
            have += 1

        while have == required: # Window contains all chars from t

            # Update minimum window size
            if (right - left + 1) < min_len:
                min_len = (right - left + 1)
                start_index = left

            # Shrink the window from the left
            left_char = s[left]
            window[left_char] -= 1
            if left_char in need and window[left_char] < need[left_char]:
                have -= 1

            left += 1

    if min_len == float('inf'):
        return ""  # No window found

    return s[start_index : start_index + min_len]


# Example usage
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
result = min_window_substring(s, t)
print(f"Minimum window substring: {result}") # Output: BANC

s = "a"
t = "aa"
result = min_window_substring(s, t)
print(f"Minimum window substring: {result}") # Output: ""

s = "aa"
t = "aa"
result = min_window_substring(s, t)
print(f"Minimum window substring: {result}") # Output: aa
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`min_window_substring(s, t)` Function:**
    *   Takes the input strings `s` and `t` as arguments.
    *   Handles the base case of empty strings `s` or `t`.
    *   Initializes `need` to store the frequency of each character in `t`.
    *   Initializes `window` to store the frequency of each character in the current window of `s`.
    *   `have` counts the number of characters in `t` that are satisfied in `window`.  `required` is the number of unique characters in `t`.
    *   `left` is the left boundary of the sliding window.
    *   `min_len` stores the length of the minimum window found so far, initialized to infinity.
    *   `start_index` stores the starting index of the minimum window.
    *   Iterates through the string `s` using `right` as the right boundary of the sliding window:
        *   Expands the window by adding `s[right]` to the `window`.
        *   If `s[right]` is in `t` and its count in `window` meets or exceeds the count in `need`, increment `have`.
        *   **`while have == required:`**: This is the core of the sliding window. It means the current window contains all characters in `t` with the required frequencies.
            *   Updates `min_len` and `start_index` if the current window is smaller than the previously found minimum window.
            *   Contracts the window from the left:
                *   Removes the leftmost character (`s[left]`) from the `window`.
                *   If `s[left]` is in `t` and removing it makes the frequency in `window` less than required in `need`, decrement `have`.
                *   Moves the `left` pointer to the right.
    *   If `min_len` remains infinity, it means no valid window was found, so returns "".
    *   Otherwise, returns the minimum window substring from `s[start_index : start_index + min_len]`.

2.  **`defaultdict(int)`:**  This is used for both `need` and `window`. `defaultdict(int)` is a dictionary-like structure where, if you try to access a key that doesn't exist, it automatically creates the key with a default value of 0 (an integer in this case).  This makes the code cleaner because you don't have to check if a character exists in the dictionary before incrementing its count.

**How the Sliding Window Works:**

The algorithm uses a sliding window technique.  The window expands to the right until it finds a window that contains all the characters of string `t`. Then, the window contracts from the left while still maintaining the condition that it contains all characters of string `t`. It keeps track of the minimum window seen so far.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. Each character is visited at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer).

**Space Complexity:** O(m), where m is the number of unique characters in string `t`.  The space used by `need` and `window` is proportional to the number of unique characters in `t`.
