Okay, here's a DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists `lists`, where each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == lists.length`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other):  #  Required for heapq to compare nodes correctly
        return self.val < other.val
        
def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of ListNode objects, where each represents a sorted linked list.

    Returns:
        A ListNode object representing the head of the merged sorted linked list.  Returns None if `lists` is empty or contains only empty lists.
    """

    heap = []

    # Push the head nodes of all linked lists into the min-heap.
    for head in lists:
        if head:  # Only add if the list is not empty.
            heapq.heappush(heap, head)

    # Create a dummy node to simplify the merging process.
    dummy = ListNode()
    tail = dummy

    # While the heap is not empty:
    while heap:
        # Pop the node with the smallest value from the heap.
        smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)

        # Append the smallest node to the tail of the merged list.
        tail.next = smallest
        tail = tail.next

        # If the smallest node has a next node, push it into the heap.
        if smallest.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest.next)

    # Return the head of the merged list (excluding the dummy node).
    return dummy.next

# Example Usage and Testing (Optional)
def list_to_linked_list(lst):
    """Helper function to convert a list to a linked list."""
    dummy = ListNode()
    tail = dummy
    for val in lst:
        tail.next = ListNode(val)
        tail = tail.next
    return dummy.next

def linked_list_to_list(head):
    """Helper function to convert a linked list to a list."""
    result = []
    while head:
        result.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Test Case 1
    lists1 = [list_to_linked_list([1, 4, 5]), list_to_linked_list([1, 3, 4]), list_to_linked_list([2, 6])]
    merged_list1 = mergeKLists(lists1)
    print(f"Merged List 1: {linked_list_to_list(merged_list1)}")  # Expected: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]

    # Test Case 2 (Empty list)
    lists2 = []
    merged_list2 = mergeKLists(lists2)
    print(f"Merged List 2 (Empty): {linked_list_to_list(merged_list2)}") # Expected: []

    # Test Case 3 (List containing empty lists)
    lists3 = [None, list_to_linked_list([1,2]), None, list_to_linked_list([3,4])]
    merged_list3 = mergeKLists(lists3)
    print(f"Merged List 3 (With empty lists): {linked_list_to_list(merged_list3)}") # Expected: [1, 2, 3, 4]

    # Test Case 4 (Single list)
    lists4 = [list_to_linked_list([5])]
    merged_list4 = mergeKLists(lists4)
    print(f"Merged List 4 (Single List): {linked_list_to_list(merged_list4)}") # Expected: [5]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **ListNode Definition:** Defines the linked list node structure with `val` and `next`.  The `__lt__` method is critical for the `heapq` module to work correctly. Without this, the heap would not know how to compare `ListNode` objects, leading to incorrect heap ordering.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `heap`: A min-heap (priority queue) to store the head nodes of the linked lists.  We'll use `heapq` for this.
        *   `dummy`: A dummy `ListNode` to simplify the construction of the merged list.
        *   `tail`: A pointer to the tail of the merged list.

    *   **Populating the Heap:**
        *   Iterates through the `lists`.  If a list is not empty (i.e., `head` is not `None`), it pushes the head node onto the `heap`.  Using `heapq.heappush` ensures the heap property is maintained.  Since `ListNode` now has `__lt__`, the heap orders elements by their `val` attribute.

    *   **Merging:**
        *   The `while heap` loop continues as long as there are nodes in the heap.
        *   `heapq.heappop(heap)` retrieves and removes the node with the smallest value from the heap.  This is the next node to be added to the merged list.
        *   `tail.next = smallest`:  The `smallest` node is appended to the `tail` of the merged list.
        *   `tail = tail.next`:  The `tail` pointer is moved to the newly added node.
        *   If the `smallest` node has a `next` node (i.e., it's not the last node in its original list), `smallest.next` is pushed onto the heap to be considered in future merges.

    *   **Returning the Merged List:**  `dummy.next` returns the head of the merged list (skipping the dummy node).

3. **Helper Functions (Optional):** The `list_to_linked_list` and `linked_list_to_list` functions are provided for easy testing and demonstration purposes. They allow you to create linked lists from regular Python lists and convert linked lists back to lists for verification.

4. **Example Usage/Testing:**  The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block contains example usage with several test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the `mergeKLists` function. These tests cover different scenarios, including empty lists, lists with empty lists as elements, and single lists, to ensure that the function works correctly.

**Key Concepts Used:**

*   **Linked Lists:**  Understanding the structure and manipulation of linked lists is fundamental.
*   **Min-Heap (Priority Queue):**  The min-heap data structure is crucial for efficiently finding the smallest element among the k lists at each step.  The `heapq` module in Python provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm.
*   **Heapify:** implicitly used in the heappush and heappop
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all the linked lists, and k is the number of linked lists.  The log k factor comes from the heap operations.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of linked lists (for the heap).  O(1) extra space if you modify the input list in place (which I didn't do in this example for clarity).

This approach efficiently merges the sorted linked lists by repeatedly finding the smallest element among the heads of the lists using a min-heap.
