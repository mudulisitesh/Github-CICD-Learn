Okay, here's a DSA problem, along with a Python solution and explanation.

**Problem:  First Unique Character in a String**

Given a string `s`, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

**Example:**

*   `s = "leetcode"`  -> Return `0` (index of 'l')
*   `s = "loveleetcode"` -> Return `2` (index of 'v')
*   `s = "aabb"` -> Return `-1`

**Conceptual Understanding and Approach**

The core idea is to:

1.  **Count Character Frequencies:**  We need to determine how many times each character appears in the string.  A dictionary (hash map) is perfect for this.  We'll iterate through the string, and for each character, we increment its count in the dictionary.

2.  **Find the First Unique:**  After counting, we iterate through the string *again*.  This time, for each character, we look up its count in the dictionary.  If the count is 1, we've found the first unique character, so we return its index.

3.  **Handle No Unique Character:** If we complete the second iteration without finding a character with a count of 1, it means there are no unique characters in the string, so we return -1.

**Python Code Solution**

```python
def firstUniqChar(s):
    """
    Finds the index of the first unique character in a string.

    Args:
        s: The input string.

    Returns:
        The index of the first unique character, or -1 if none exists.
    """

    char_counts = {}  # Dictionary to store character counts

    # Count character frequencies
    for char in s:
        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1 #If char exist then add 1 otherwise set to 0

    # Find the first unique character
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char_counts[char] == 1:
            return i

    # No unique character found
    return -1

# Example usage:
print(firstUniqChar("leetcode"))   # Output: 0
print(firstUniqChar("loveleetcode"))  # Output: 2
print(firstUniqChar("aabb"))      # Output: -1
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`char_counts = {}`:**  Initializes an empty dictionary to store character counts.

2.  **`for char in s:` loop:**  Iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
    *   **`char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1`:**  This line does the counting:
        *   `char_counts.get(char, 0)`:  This attempts to retrieve the current count of the character `char` from the dictionary.  If the character is *not* already in the dictionary, `get()` returns the default value `0`.
        *   `+ 1`:  We increment the count by 1.
        *   `char_counts[char] = ...`:  We update the dictionary with the new count for the character.

3.  **`for i, char in enumerate(s):` loop:**  Iterates through the string *again*, but this time we also have the index `i` of each character.
    *   **`if char_counts[char] == 1:`:**  Checks if the count of the current character `char` in the `char_counts` dictionary is equal to 1.  If it is, it means the character is unique.
    *   **`return i`:**  If the character is unique, we immediately return its index `i`.

4.  **`return -1`:**  If the loop completes without finding any character with a count of 1, we return -1 to indicate that there are no unique characters in the string.

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the string `s`.  We iterate through the string twice (once to count and once to find the unique).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). While we're using a dictionary, in the worst case (where all characters are unique) the dictionary will store, at most, the number of characters in the alphabet (26 for lowercase English letters, etc.).  This is considered constant space because the maximum size is bounded by the alphabet size and doesn't depend directly on the input string's length. If we consider Unicode then the space complexity would be O(U) where U is the number of unique unicode chars in the string.

**Key improvements and considerations:**
*   **Clarity:** The code is well-commented and easy to understand.
*   **Efficiency:** Using a dictionary provides fast lookups for character counts.  The two loops iterate efficiently to solve the problem.
*   **Correctness:** The code handles the edge case where there are no unique characters in the string.
*   **Readability:** The variable names are descriptive.
*   **`enumerate()` usage:**  Using `enumerate()` is the Pythonic way to iterate through a sequence while getting both the index and the value.
This solution provides a robust and well-explained approach to finding the first unique character in a string.
