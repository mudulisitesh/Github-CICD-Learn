Okay, here's a DSA problem along with a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Linked Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == len(lists)`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other):  # Required for heap comparison
        return self.val < other.val
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: list[ListNode]) -> ListNode:
        """
        Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

        Args:
            lists: A list of ListNode objects, where each ListNode represents the head
                   of a sorted linked list.

        Returns:
            The head of the merged sorted linked list, or None if the input list is empty.
        """

        heap = [] #min heap

        # Push the head of each list onto the heap.
        for i in range(len(lists)):
            if lists[i]:  #avoid pushing none values
                 heapq.heappush(heap, lists[i])


        dummy = ListNode(0)  # Dummy node for the merged list
        current = dummy

        while heap:
            # Pop the smallest node from the heap.
            node = heapq.heappop(heap)
            current.next = node
            current = current.next

            # If the popped node has a next node, push it onto the heap.
            if node.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap, node.next)

        return dummy.next
#Example Usage (for testing):
if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Create some sample linked lists:
    list1 = ListNode(1, ListNode(4, ListNode(5)))
    list2 = ListNode(1, ListNode(3, ListNode(4)))
    list3 = ListNode(2, ListNode(6))

    lists = [list1, list2, list3]

    solution = Solution()
    merged_list = solution.mergeKLists(lists)

    # Print the merged list (for verification):
    while merged_list:
        print(merged_list.val, end=" ")
        merged_list = merged_list.next
    print() # newline

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ListNode` Class:** Defines the structure of a node in the linked list, with `val` (the node's value) and `next` (a pointer to the next node).  The `__lt__` method is crucial; it defines how `ListNode` objects are compared. The `heapq` library relies on this to properly maintain the min-heap property.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `heap = []`: Initializes an empty min-heap.  We'll use this to keep track of the smallest nodes across all the linked lists.
        *   `dummy = ListNode(0)`: Creates a dummy node.  This is a common technique for building linked lists; it simplifies the logic.  We'll attach the merged list to the `next` of the dummy node.
        *   `current = dummy`: `current` is a pointer that will traverse the merged list as we build it.
    *   **Heap Initialization:**
        *   The code iterates through the input `lists`. For each linked list, it checks if the list is not empty (`if lists[i]:`). If it's not empty, the head node (`lists[i]`) is pushed onto the heap. Crucially, the `__lt__` method of the `ListNode` ensures that the smallest node will always be at the top of the heap.
    *   **Merging:**
        *   `while heap:`: The main loop continues as long as the heap is not empty (meaning there are still nodes to process).
        *   `node = heapq.heappop(heap)`: The smallest node (`node`) is extracted from the heap.
        *   `current.next = node`:  The extracted node is appended to the merged list.
        *   `current = current.next`:  The `current` pointer is moved to the newly added node.
        *   `if node.next:`: If the extracted node had a `next` node, it means there are more elements in that particular linked list. So, the `next` node is pushed onto the heap.
    *   **Return:**  Finally, `dummy.next` is returned, which is the head of the merged sorted linked list.

**How the Heap Works (Key Concept):**

The min-heap ensures that you always have quick access to the node with the smallest value among all the lists.  When you pop a node, you know it's the smallest, so you can add it to the merged list.  Then, if that node had a `next` node in its original list, you add the `next` node to the heap, maintaining the sorted order.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all the linked lists, and k is the number of linked lists.  Each node is added to and removed from the heap once, and heap operations take O(log k) time.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(k), where k is the number of linked lists. This is the space used by the min-heap to store the head nodes of the lists.  In the worst case, the heap will contain one node from each list.  The space complexity of the output list itself is O(N), but that's usually not counted when analyzing the auxiliary space complexity of the algorithm.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Heap Customization:** The heap in Python's `heapq` module works on built-in types like integers and strings directly.  For custom objects (like `ListNode`), you need to define a comparison operator (like `__lt__`) so the heap knows how to order them.
*   **Handling Empty Lists:**  The code explicitly checks for empty lists (`if lists[i]`) to avoid adding `None` values to the heap, which would cause errors.
*   **Dummy Node:** Using a dummy node at the beginning greatly simplifies the linked list construction.  Without it, you'd need to handle the special case of the first node separately.
*   **Alternatives:** While the heap-based approach is common and efficient, there are other ways to solve this problem (e.g., repeatedly merging two lists at a time), but they are generally less efficient.
