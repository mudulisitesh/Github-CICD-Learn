Okay, here's a DSA problem followed by a Python solution with explanations:

**Problem:**

**Merge Overlapping Intervals**

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example:**

Input: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

Explanation: `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap (2 is between 1 and 3), so they are merged to `[1,6]`.

Input: `[[1,4],[4,5]]`
Output: `[[1,5]]`
Explanation: `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two integers [start, end].

    Returns:
        A new list of merged intervals.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals by start time.  Crucial for the algorithm to work correctly.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
        # interval does not overlap with the last interval, simply append it.
        if not merged or interval[0] > merged[-1][1]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current interval
            # with the last interval.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

    return merged

# Example Usage
intervals1 = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
result1 = merge_intervals(intervals1)
print(f"Input: {intervals1}, Output: {result1}")  # Output: Input: [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]], Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
result2 = merge_intervals(intervals2)
print(f"Input: {intervals2}, Output: {result2}")  # Output: Input: [[1, 4], [4, 5]], Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
result3 = merge_intervals(intervals3)
print(f"Input: {intervals3}, Output: {result3}") # Output: Input: [[1, 4], [0, 4]], Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
result4 = merge_intervals(intervals4)
print(f"Input: {intervals4}, Output: {result4}") # Output: Input: [[1, 4], [0, 0]], Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]

intervals5 = [[1,4],[0,2],[3,5]]
result5 = merge_intervals(intervals5)
print(f"Input: {intervals5}, Output: {result5}")  #Output: Input: [[1, 4], [0, 2], [3, 5]], Output: [[0, 5]]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`merge_intervals(intervals)` Function:**
   - Takes a list of `intervals` as input, where each `interval` is a list of two integers `[start, end]`.
   - Handles the base case where the input list is empty.
   - **Sorting:** The most important step is to sort the intervals based on their start times using `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])`.  This sorting is *crucial* because it allows us to iterate through the intervals in order and easily check for overlaps with the *last merged interval*.
   - **`merged` List:**  This list will store the final merged intervals.
   - **Iteration:** The code iterates through the sorted `intervals`.
   - **Overlap Check:**  For each `interval`, it checks if it overlaps with the last interval added to the `merged` list.  There are two cases:
     - **No Overlap:** If the `merged` list is empty (first interval) or if the current interval's start time is greater than the end time of the last interval in `merged` (i.e., `interval[0] > merged[-1][1]`), then there's no overlap.  In this case, the current `interval` is simply appended to the `merged` list.
     - **Overlap:** If the current interval's start time is less than or equal to the end time of the last interval in `merged`, there's an overlap.  We merge them by updating the end time of the last interval in `merged` to be the maximum of the current interval's end time and the last interval's end time: `merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])`.
   - **Return:** Finally, the function returns the `merged` list, which contains the merged intervals.

2. **Example Usage:**
   - The code provides example inputs and prints the results of calling `merge_intervals` on them.  This helps demonstrate how the function works with different input scenarios.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) because of the sorting step. The rest of the algorithm is O(n).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where no intervals overlap, and we store all the intervals in the `merged` list.  In some cases, it might be O(1) if the original list can be modified in place (but the solution avoids this for clarity and generality).
