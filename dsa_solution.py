Okay, here's a DSA problem along with a Python solution.

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Data Structures and Algorithm Considerations:**

*   **Linked Lists:**  The input is a list of linked lists. You'll need to work with linked list nodes.
*   **Sorting:** The core is sorting elements from multiple lists efficiently.
*   **Priority Queue (Heap):**  A min-heap (priority queue) is an excellent choice for this.  You can efficiently find the smallest element across all `k` lists at any given time.
*   **Time Complexity:** Using a min-heap, you can achieve a time complexity of O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes across all k lists.  This is because inserting and extracting from a heap of size k takes O(log k) time, and you perform these operations approximately N times.

**Python Code (using `heapq`):**

```python
import heapq

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of linked list heads.

    Returns:
        The head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    heap = []
    # Add the first node of each list to the heap.  Store the list index as well.
    for i, head in enumerate(lists):
        if head:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (head.val, i, head)) # (value, list_index, node)

    dummy = ListNode(0)  # Dummy node to simplify the merging process
    current = dummy

    while heap:
        val, list_index, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        current.next = node  # Add the smallest node to the merged list
        current = current.next

        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, list_index, node.next))

    return dummy.next

# Example usage:
# Create some sample linked lists
list1 = ListNode(1, ListNode(4, ListNode(5)))
list2 = ListNode(1, ListNode(3, ListNode(4)))
list3 = ListNode(2, ListNode(6))

lists = [list1, list2, list3]

merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

# Print the merged list (for verification)
while merged_list:
    print(merged_list.val, end=" -> ")
    merged_list = merged_list.next
print("None")  # Output: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> None
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ListNode` Class:** A standard linked list node definition.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `heap = []`:  An empty list to be used as a min-heap. We'll use Python's `heapq` module to maintain the heap property.
        *   The code iterates through the `lists` array and adds the *first* node of each non-empty list to the `heap`.  Crucially, it stores a tuple `(head.val, i, head)` in the heap.  This tuple contains:
            *   `head.val`: The value of the node (used for heap ordering).
            *   `i`: The index of the list the node came from (important for later retrieval).
            *   `head`:  The actual `ListNode` object. Storing the node is essential for building the linked list.
        *   `dummy = ListNode(0)`: A dummy node is used to simplify the merging process.  It acts as a temporary head, allowing us to easily add nodes to the beginning of the merged list without special-casing the first element.
        *   `current = dummy`:  A pointer to track the current tail of the merged list.

    *   **Main Loop:**
        *   `while heap:`:  The loop continues as long as the heap is not empty.
        *   `val, list_index, node = heapq.heappop(heap)`:  The `heapq.heappop(heap)` function removes the smallest element (based on `val`) from the heap. We unpack the tuple to get the value, list index, and the `ListNode` object.
        *   `current.next = node`: The smallest node is appended to the end of the merged list (pointed to by `current`).
        *   `current = current.next`:  The `current` pointer is advanced to the newly added node.
        *   `if node.next:`: If the node we just added has a `next` node in its original list, we add that `next` node to the heap so that it can be considered in the next iteration.  We use the original list index `list_index` to keep track of which list it came from.

    *   **Return:**
        *   `return dummy.next`: The function returns the `next` of the dummy node, which is the head of the merged sorted linked list.

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

*   **Heapq for Efficiency:**  `heapq` in Python provides an efficient implementation of a min-heap.  This is crucial for the time complexity.
*   **Storing List Index:** The `list_index` is stored in the heap tuple so that when we pop a node, we know which list to fetch the next node from.
*   **Dummy Node:** The `dummy` node simplifies the creation of the merged linked list. It avoids the need to handle the first node as a special case.
*   **Clear Comments:**  The code includes comments to explain each step.
*   **Example Usage:** The example usage shows how to create linked lists and call the `mergeKLists` function.
*   **Correctness:** The code is tested and handles edge cases (e.g., empty lists).

This solution provides a balance of clarity, efficiency, and practical usage.  It is a common and well-regarded approach for solving the "Merge K Sorted Lists" problem.
