Okay, here's a random DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == lists.length`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution (using a Min-Heap):**

```python
import heapq

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
      lists: A list of linked lists, where each list is sorted.

    Returns:
      The head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    # Create a min-heap.  We store (value, list_index) tuples in the heap.
    # list_index is needed to know which list to pull the next node from.
    heap = []

    # Initialize the heap with the heads of the non-empty lists.
    for i in range(len(lists)):
        if lists[i]:  # Check if the list is not empty
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i))
            lists[i] = lists[i].next  # advance to the next node

    # Create a dummy head for the merged list.
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    tail = dummy

    # While the heap is not empty:
    while heap:
        # Get the smallest value from the heap.
        val, list_index = heapq.heappop(heap)

        # Add the node to the merged list.
        tail.next = ListNode(val)
        tail = tail.next

        # Check if there are more nodes in the list from which we just took a node.
        if lists[list_index]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[list_index].val, list_index))
            lists[list_index] = lists[list_index].next

    return dummy.next  # Return the merged list (excluding the dummy head).

# Example usage and helper function to create linked lists
def create_linked_list(arr):
    if not arr:
        return None
    head = ListNode(arr[0])
    curr = head
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        curr.next = ListNode(arr[i])
        curr = curr.next
    return head

def linked_list_to_array(head):
    result = []
    curr = head
    while curr:
        result.append(curr.val)
        curr = curr.next
    return result

# Example
lists = [
    create_linked_list([1, 4, 5]),
    create_linked_list([1, 3, 4]),
    create_linked_list([2, 6])
]

merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)
print(linked_list_to_array(merged_list)) # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **ListNode Class:** Defines the standard linked list node structure.
2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` function:**
    *   **Heap Initialization:**
        *   A min-heap `heap` is created using `heapq`.  The heap stores tuples of `(value, list_index)`.  The `value` is used for sorting, and `list_index` is crucial for tracking which list a given node came from, so we can efficiently advance to the next node in that list.
        *   The code iterates through the input `lists`. For each non-empty linked list, it pushes the value of the head node and the list's index into the heap. Importantly, it also *advances* the head of that list to the next node. This ensures that the original `lists` array is effectively storing the *remaining* (unprocessed) portions of the lists as the algorithm progresses.
    *   **Dummy Node:**  A `dummy` node is created. This simplifies the process of building the merged list, as we don't have to worry about special cases for the head.
    *   **Merging Loop:**
        *   While the heap is not empty:
            *   `heapq.heappop(heap)` retrieves and removes the smallest value (along with its list index) from the heap.
            *   A new `ListNode` is created with the extracted value, and it's appended to the `tail` of the merged list.  `tail` is then advanced to the newly added node.
            *   The code then checks if there are more nodes remaining in the list from which the node was just taken (using the `list_index`). If so, it pushes the next node's value (and the list index) onto the heap, again advancing the corresponding list in the `lists` array to its next node.
    *   **Return Value:** The function returns `dummy.next`, which is the head of the merged sorted linked list (excluding the dummy node).

3. **`create_linked_list(arr)` helper function:**  Converts an array into a linked list.
4. **`linked_list_to_array(head)` helper function:** Converts a linked list into an array for easy printing and verification.

**Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all the lists, and k is the number of lists.  We perform `N` heap operations, and each heap operation takes O(log k) time.

**Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of linked lists.  The heap stores at most one node from each list at any given time. In the worst-case scenario, the heap can grow to contain all the heads of the linked lists.

This is a common and well-regarded solution for the "Merge K Sorted Lists" problem. The use of a min-heap provides an efficient way to track and select the smallest value from all the lists at each step.
