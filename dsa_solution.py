Okay, here's a problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Lists**

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == len(lists)`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Code Solution (using a min-heap / priority queue):**

```python
import heapq

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
      lists: A list of ListNode objects, where each ListNode is the head of a sorted linked list.

    Returns:
      A ListNode object representing the head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    heap = []  # Min-heap to store (value, list_index, node) tuples
    for i in range(len(lists)):
        if lists[i]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i, lists[i]))

    dummy = ListNode()  # Dummy head node for the result list
    curr = dummy

    while heap:
        val, list_index, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        curr.next = node
        curr = curr.next

        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, list_index, node.next))

    return dummy.next


# Example usage (you'll need to create ListNode objects to test)

# Helper function to create a linked list from a list of values
def create_linked_list(values):
    if not values:
        return None
    head = ListNode(values[0])
    curr = head
    for i in range(1, len(values)):
        curr.next = ListNode(values[i])
        curr = curr.next
    return head

# Helper function to print a linked list
def print_linked_list(head):
    curr = head
    while curr:
        print(curr.val, end=" -> ")
        curr = curr.next
    print("None")



if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example usage:
    list1 = create_linked_list([1, 4, 5])
    list2 = create_linked_list([1, 3, 4])
    list3 = create_linked_list([2, 6])

    lists = [list1, list2, list3]

    merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

    print("Merged List:")
    print_linked_list(merged_list) #Output: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> None
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **ListNode Class:**  Defines a node structure for a singly linked list.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` function:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `heap`: A min-heap (priority queue) is used to efficiently track the smallest element across all `k` lists.  We store tuples in the heap of the form `(value, list_index, node)`, where:
            *   `value` is the value of the node.
            *   `list_index` is the index of the list the node belongs to. This is important for keeping track of which list to advance when we pop an element from the heap.
            *   `node` is the actual `ListNode` object.
        *   `dummy`: A dummy head node is created to simplify the process of building the merged list.  We'll return `dummy.next`.
        *   `curr`: A pointer to the current tail of the merged list.

    *   **Building the Heap:**  The code iterates through the `lists` array.  If a list is not empty (i.e., `lists[i]` is not `None`), the first node of that list (along with its value and index) is pushed onto the heap using `heapq.heappush()`.

    *   **Merging (Main Loop):**
        *   `while heap:`: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the heap.
        *   `val, list_index, node = heapq.heappop(heap)`: The smallest element (minimum `val`) is popped from the heap, along with its list index and the node itself.  `heapq.heappop()` always returns the smallest element in the heap.
        *   `curr.next = node`: The popped node (`node`) is appended to the merged list (pointed to by `curr`).
        *   `curr = curr.next`:  The `curr` pointer is moved to the newly added node.
        *   `if node.next:`: If the popped node has a next node in its original list, that next node is pushed onto the heap, so it can be considered for merging in subsequent iterations.

    *   **Return:**  Finally, `dummy.next` is returned, which is the head of the merged sorted linked list.

3.  **Helper Functions:**  `create_linked_list` and `print_linked_list` are provided to make it easier to create test cases and verify the output.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all the linked lists and k is the number of linked lists.  The `heapq.heappush` and `heapq.heappop` operations take O(log k) time, and we perform these operations for each of the N nodes.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(k), because the heap can contain at most one node from each of the `k` lists at any time.

**Key Concepts Used:**

*   **Linked Lists:**  The fundamental data structure for the problem.
*   **Min-Heap (Priority Queue):**  Essential for efficiently finding the smallest element among the heads of the `k` lists.  The `heapq` module in Python provides a convenient implementation of a min-heap.
*   **Dummy Node:** A common technique used to simplify linked list manipulations.
*   **Divide and Conquer (implicitly):**  While not explicitly a recursive divide-and-conquer solution, the min-heap approach effectively divides the problem by maintaining a "pool" of smallest elements from each list and iteratively merging them.

This solution is generally considered the most efficient for the Merge K Sorted Lists problem.  I hope this explanation is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
