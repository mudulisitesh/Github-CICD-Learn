Okay, here's a DSA problem along with a Python solution.

**Problem:**

**Minimum Platforms Required for a Railway Station**

Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train waits.

You are given two arrays, `arrivals` and `departures`, representing the arrival and departure times of trains.  Assume that all times are given in the 24-hour format (e.g., 9:00 is 9, 18:30 is 18.5).

**Example:**

```
arrivals = [9.00, 9.40, 9.50, 11.00, 15.00, 18.00]
departures = [9.10, 12.00, 11.20, 11.30, 19.00, 20.00]

Output: 3
```

**Explanation:**

At time 9:40, we have 2 trains on the platform (9.00 and 9.40 arrivals).
At time 9:50, we have 3 trains on the platform (9.00, 9.40, and 9.50 arrivals).
Then 9.00 leaves at 9:10, but the 9:40 and 9:50 are still there.
...and so on.  We need 3 platforms to handle the maximum overlap.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def min_platforms(arrivals, departures):
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of platforms required at a railway station.

    Args:
        arrivals: A list of arrival times.
        departures: A list of departure times.

    Returns:
        The minimum number of platforms required.
    """

    arrivals.sort()
    departures.sort()

    platforms_needed = 0
    max_platforms = 0
    i = 0  # Index for arrivals
    j = 0  # Index for departures

    while i < len(arrivals) and j < len(departures):
        if arrivals[i] <= departures[j]:
            platforms_needed += 1
            max_platforms = max(max_platforms, platforms_needed)
            i += 1
        else:
            platforms_needed -= 1
            j += 1

    return max_platforms

# Example usage:
arrivals = [9.00, 9.40, 9.50, 11.00, 15.00, 18.00]
departures = [9.10, 12.00, 11.20, 11.30, 19.00, 20.00]

result = min_platforms(arrivals, departures)
print(f"Minimum platforms required: {result}")  # Output: 3
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Sorting:** The `arrivals` and `departures` lists are sorted in ascending order. This is crucial for the algorithm to work correctly because it allows us to process events chronologically.

2. **Two Pointers:**  We use two pointers, `i` (for arrivals) and `j` (for departures).  We iterate through the sorted lists using these pointers.

3. **Comparison:**
   - If `arrivals[i] <= departures[j]`, it means a train has arrived before another train has departed. Therefore, we need an additional platform.  We increment `platforms_needed` and update `max_platforms` if necessary.  We then increment `i` to consider the next arrival.
   - If `arrivals[i] > departures[j]`, it means a train has departed, so we can free up a platform. We decrement `platforms_needed` and increment `j` to consider the next departure.

4. **`max_platforms`:**  We keep track of the maximum number of platforms needed at any point in time using the `max_platforms` variable.

5. **Return Value:**  The function returns `max_platforms`, which represents the minimum number of platforms required to avoid any waiting.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of trains, due to the sorting operations.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) (constant) -  We are using a constant amount of extra space for variables. Note: the sorting algorithm itself might use some extra space depending on the implementation (e.g., mergesort uses O(n), but heapsort can be done in-place in O(1)).  In practice, Python's `sort()` uses Timsort, which has a worst-case space complexity of O(n), but in many practical cases, it's closer to O(1).
