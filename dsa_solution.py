Okay, here's a randomly generated DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Minimum Platforms**

Given arrival and departure times of trains on a single railway platform, find the minimum number of platforms required so that no train waits.

You are given two arrays, `arrival` and `departure`, representing the arrival and departure times of trains, respectively. Assume that all times are in 24-hour format (e.g., 0900 means 9:00 AM, 1430 means 2:30 PM).  The times are represented as integers for simplicity (e.g., 900 instead of "09:00").

**Example:**

```
arrival = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800]
departure = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
```

In this case, the minimum number of platforms required is 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= len(arrival) <= 1000`
*   `len(arrival) == len(departure)`
*   Arrival and departure times are non-negative integers.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def min_platforms(arrival, departure):
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of platforms required at a railway station.

    Args:
        arrival: A list of arrival times of trains.
        departure: A list of departure times of trains.

    Returns:
        The minimum number of platforms required.
    """

    arrival.sort()
    departure.sort()

    platforms_needed = 1
    max_platforms = 1
    i = 1  # Index for arrival array
    j = 0  # Index for departure array

    while i < len(arrival) and j < len(departure):
        if arrival[i] <= departure[j]:
            platforms_needed += 1
            i += 1
            if platforms_needed > max_platforms:
                max_platforms = platforms_needed
        else:
            platforms_needed -= 1
            j += 1

    return max_platforms

# Example usage
arrival = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800]
departure = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
result = min_platforms(arrival, departure)
print(f"Minimum platforms required: {result}")  # Output: Minimum platforms required: 3

arrival2 = [900, 940]
departure2 = [910, 1200]
result2 = min_platforms(arrival2, departure2)
print(f"Minimum platforms required: {result2}")  # Output: Minimum platforms required: 1

arrival3 = [100, 200, 300, 400]
departure3 = [500, 600, 700, 800]
result3 = min_platforms(arrival3, departure3)
print(f"Minimum platforms required: {result3}")  # Output: Minimum platforms required: 1

arrival4 = [100, 140, 150, 200, 215, 400]
departure4 = [110, 300, 220, 230, 315, 600]
result4 = min_platforms(arrival4, departure4)
print(f"Minimum platforms required: {result4}") # Output: Minimum platforms required: 4
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Sorting:** The key idea is to sort both the `arrival` and `departure` arrays in ascending order.  This allows us to process the events in chronological order.

2.  **Two Pointers:** We use two pointers, `i` for `arrival` and `j` for `departure`. We iterate through the sorted arrays.

3.  **Incrementing Platforms:** If the next event is an arrival (`arrival[i] <= departure[j]`), it means a new train is arriving while a previous train might still be occupying a platform.  So, we increment `platforms_needed`. We also update `max_platforms` if the current `platforms_needed` is greater than the maximum observed so far.

4.  **Decrementing Platforms:** If the next event is a departure (`arrival[i] > departure[j]`), it means a train has departed, freeing up a platform. So, we decrement `platforms_needed`.

5.  **Return Max Platforms:** After processing all the arrival and departure events, `max_platforms` will hold the maximum number of platforms that were needed simultaneously, which is the minimum number of platforms required.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting of the `arrival` and `departure` arrays, where n is the number of trains. The while loop iterates at most 2n times so it's O(n), dominated by the sorting.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) -  We are not using any significant extra space.  Sorting in-place might technically use O(log n) space depending on the sorting algorithm's implementation in the language, but we consider it O(1) here.
