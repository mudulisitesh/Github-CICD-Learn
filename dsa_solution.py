Okay, here's a DSA problem along with a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge Intervals**

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

*   **Input:** A list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a list of two integers `[start, end]`.

*   **Output:** A list of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

*   **Example:**

    *   Input: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
    *   Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
    *   Explanation: Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,6]`.

**Python Code Solution:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list [start, end].

    Returns:
        A list of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the input intervals.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals by their starting points.  This is crucial for the algorithm to work.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
        # interval does not overlap with the last interval, append it.
        if not merged or interval[0] > merged[-1][1]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current interval
            # with the last interval.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

    return merged

# Example usage:
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
merged_intervals = merge_intervals(intervals)
print(f"Input: {intervals}")
print(f"Merged intervals: {merged_intervals}")  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
merged_intervals2 = merge_intervals(intervals2)
print(f"Input: {intervals2}")
print(f"Merged intervals: {merged_intervals2}") #Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
merged_intervals3 = merge_intervals(intervals3)
print(f"Input: {intervals3}")
print(f"Merged intervals: {merged_intervals3}") #Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
merged_intervals4 = merge_intervals(intervals4)
print(f"Input: {intervals4}")
print(f"Merged intervals: {merged_intervals4}") #Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]

intervals5 = [[1,4],[0,2],[3,5]]
merged_intervals5 = merge_intervals(intervals5)
print(f"Input: {intervals5}")
print(f"Merged intervals: {merged_intervals5}") #Output: [[0, 5]]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Sort Intervals:** The most important step is to sort the intervals based on their start times. This allows us to process them in order and easily check for overlaps.  We use `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` to sort the list `intervals` in place. The `lambda x: x[0]` is a small anonymous function that returns the first element (the start time) of each interval for the sorting process.

2.  **Initialization:** We create an empty list called `merged` to store the merged intervals.

3.  **Iteration:** We iterate through the sorted intervals.
    *   **No Overlap:** If the `merged` list is empty or the current interval's start time is greater than the end time of the last interval in `merged`, it means there's no overlap. We simply append the current interval to `merged`.
    *   **Overlap:** If there's an overlap (the current interval's start time is less than or equal to the end time of the last interval in `merged`), we merge the intervals. We update the end time of the last interval in `merged` to be the maximum of its original end time and the current interval's end time. This ensures that the merged interval covers the entire range of both overlapping intervals.

4.  **Return:** Finally, we return the `merged` list, which contains the non-overlapping intervals.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) because of the sorting step. The rest of the algorithm takes O(n) time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where no intervals overlap, and we need to store all the intervals in the `merged` list.  If the input is modified in-place and only a fixed amount of additional space is used, then the space complexity can be O(1).
