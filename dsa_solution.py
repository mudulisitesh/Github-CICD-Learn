Okay, here's a random DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge Overlapping Intervals**

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Another Example:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= intervals[i][0] <= intervals[i][1] <= 104`

**Python Solution:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two integers [start, end].

    Returns:
        A list of merged intervals.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals based on their start times. This is crucial!
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the merged list is empty or the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in the merged list,
        # simply append it.
        if not merged or interval[0] > merged[-1][1]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current interval with the last interval in the merged list.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

    return merged

# Example usage:
intervals1 = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
result1 = merge_intervals(intervals1)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals1}: {result1}")  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
result2 = merge_intervals(intervals2)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals2}: {result2}")  # Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
result3 = merge_intervals(intervals3)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals3}: {result3}") # Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
result4 = merge_intervals(intervals4)
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals4}: {result4}") # Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Sort Intervals:**  The most important step is to sort the intervals based on their start times.  This allows us to iterate through the intervals in order and efficiently determine overlaps.  We use `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` to sort by the first element (start time) of each interval.
2.  **Initialize `merged` list:** This list will store the merged intervals.
3.  **Iterate through intervals:**  The code iterates through the sorted intervals one by one.
4.  **Check for Overlap:**
    *   `if not merged or interval[0] > merged[-1][1]:` This condition checks if the `merged` list is empty (first interval) or if the current interval's start time is greater than the end time of the last interval in `merged`.  If either of these is true, there's no overlap. In this case the `interval` is simply appended to the merged list.
    *   `else:` If the above condition is false, it means there's an overlap.
5.  **Merge Intervals:**
    *   `merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])`  If there's an overlap, the end time of the last interval in `merged` is updated to be the maximum of its current end time and the end time of the current interval. This ensures that the merged interval covers the entire range.
6.  **Return `merged`:**  Finally, the `merged` list, containing the merged intervals, is returned.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The rest of the algorithm is O(n).

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(n) in the worst case, where no intervals overlap, and the `merged` list contains all the original intervals.  In cases with substantial overlap, the space complexity will be lower.
