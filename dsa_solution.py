Okay, here's a DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:  Meeting Room Scheduling**

You are given a list of meeting time intervals where each interval consists of a start time and an end time `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`. Determine if a person could attend all meetings.  That is, check if any meetings overlap.

**Example:**

```
Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: false
```

```
Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: true
```

**Explanation:**

The problem is asking us to check if any meeting intervals overlap.  If any interval's start time falls within the time range of another interval, then they overlap, and the person cannot attend all meetings.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def can_attend_all_meetings(intervals):
    """
    Checks if a person can attend all meetings given a list of meeting time intervals.

    Args:
      intervals: A list of meeting time intervals, where each interval is a list [start, end].

    Returns:
      True if the person can attend all meetings, False otherwise.
    """

    # Sort the intervals by start time. This makes checking for overlaps easier.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort by start time

    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        # If the current meeting starts before the previous meeting ends, then there is an overlap.
        if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]:
            return False

    return True

# Example usage:
intervals1 = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
print(f"Can attend meetings {intervals1}? {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals1)}")  # Output: False

intervals2 = [[7, 10], [2, 4]]
print(f"Can attend meetings {intervals2}? {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals2)}")  # Output: True

intervals3 = [[1, 5], [5, 8]]
print(f"Can attend meetings {intervals3}? {can_attend_all_meetings(intervals3)}")  # Output: True
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Sorting:** The `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` line sorts the meeting intervals based on their start times in ascending order.  This is crucial for efficiently checking for overlaps. Sorting by start time means that if we encounter an overlap, it *must* be with a meeting that came *before* the current one in the sorted order.

2. **Iteration and Overlap Check:**  The code then iterates through the sorted intervals, starting from the second interval (index 1).  For each interval, it compares its start time `intervals[i][0]` with the end time of the *previous* interval `intervals[i-1][1]`.

3. **Overlap Condition:**  If `intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]`, it means the current meeting starts *before* the previous meeting has ended, which indicates an overlap.  In this case, the function immediately returns `False`.

4. **No Overlap:** If the loop completes without finding any overlaps, it means the person can attend all meetings, and the function returns `True`.

**Time Complexity:**

* **Sorting:** O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals.  Most sorting algorithms (like the one used by Python's `sort()`) have a time complexity of O(n log n).
* **Iteration:** O(n), as we iterate through the intervals once.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**, dominated by the sorting step.

**Space Complexity:**

* **O(1)** - In-place sorting is used which doesn't require significant extra space. Note that some sorting algorithms can take O(n) space in worst-case scenarios, but in-place sorting is commonly used.  The rest of the code uses a constant amount of extra space.
