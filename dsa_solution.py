Okay, here's a random DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Minimum Window Substring**

Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

**Example:**

*   `s = "ADOBECODEBANC"`
*   `t = "ABC"`

*   **Output:** `"BANC"`

**Explanation:**

The minimum window substring `"BANC"` contains all the characters from `t` which are 'A', 'B', and 'C'.

**Python Solution:**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def min_window_substring(s, t):
    """
    Finds the minimum window substring of s that contains all characters of t.

    Args:
        s: The string to search in.
        t: The string containing the characters to find.

    Returns:
        The minimum window substring, or "" if no such substring exists.
    """

    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of characters in t
    t_freq = defaultdict(int)
    for char in t:
        t_freq[char] += 1

    # Initialize window variables
    window_freq = defaultdict(int)
    required = len(t_freq)  # Number of unique characters in t
    formed = 0  # Number of unique characters in t that are satisfied in the window
    left = 0
    right = 0
    min_len = float('inf')
    start = 0
    end = -1

    # Iterate through the string s
    while right < len(s):
        char = s[right]
        window_freq[char] += 1

        # If the current character is in t and its frequency in the window
        # is equal to its frequency in t, increment 'formed'
        if char in t_freq and window_freq[char] == t_freq[char]:
            formed += 1

        # Contract the window as much as possible while still containing all characters of t
        while left <= right and formed == required:
            char = s[left]

            # Update the minimum window if necessary
            if right - left + 1 < min_len:
                min_len = right - left + 1
                start = left
                end = right

            # Shrink the window from the left
            window_freq[char] -= 1

            # If shrinking the window caused the frequency of a character in t
            # to become less than its frequency in t, decrement 'formed'
            if char in t_freq and window_freq[char] < t_freq[char]:
                formed -= 1

            left += 1

        right += 1

    # Return the minimum window substring
    if min_len == float('inf'):
        return ""
    else:
        return s[start : end + 1]


# Example Usage
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
result = min_window_substring(s, t)
print(result)  # Output: BANC

s = "a"
t = "aa"
result = min_window_substring(s, t)
print(result) # Output: ""

s = "ab"
t = "a"
result = min_window_substring(s, t)
print(result) # Output: "a"
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`min_window_substring(s, t)`:** This function takes two strings `s` and `t` as input.

2.  **Frequency Dictionaries:**  We use `defaultdict(int)` to store the frequencies of characters in both `t` (`t_freq`) and the current window (`window_freq`).

3.  **Sliding Window:**
    *   `left` and `right` pointers define the boundaries of the sliding window.
    *   The `right` pointer expands the window.  As we encounter characters in `s`, we update `window_freq`.
    *   `formed` keeps track of how many *unique* characters from `t` have their required frequency met within the current window. `required` is the number of unique characters in `t`.
    *   Once `formed == required`, it means the current window contains all the characters of `t`.  Now, we try to contract the window from the left (`left` pointer) to find the minimum possible length.

4.  **Contracting the Window:**
    *   We move the `left` pointer to the right, shrinking the window.
    *   For each character we remove from the left, we update `window_freq`.
    *   If removing a character causes its frequency in the window to fall below the required frequency in `t`, we decrement `formed`.

5.  **Minimum Length Tracking:**
    *   `min_len`, `start`, and `end` keep track of the minimum window substring found so far.

6.  **Return Value:**
    *   If `min_len` remains `float('inf')`, it means no valid window was found, so we return `""`.
    *   Otherwise, we return the substring `s[start : end + 1]`.

**Time Complexity:** O(N + M) where N is the length of the string `s` and M is the length of the string `t`.  We iterate through `s` at most twice (once with `right`, and potentially once with `left`). Building `t_freq` takes O(M) time.
**Space Complexity:** O(M), mainly for storing the character frequencies in `t_freq`.  In the worst case, `window_freq` could contain all characters of `s`, but it's still bounded by the size of the alphabet.
