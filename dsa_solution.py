Okay, here's a random DSA problem and its Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge K Sorted Linked Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists, each sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation:
The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `k == lists.length`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
*   `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
*   `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
*   The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other): #Added for heapq to work correctly.
        return self.val < other.val

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of ListNode objects, each representing a sorted linked list.

    Returns:
        A ListNode object representing the head of the merged sorted linked list.
        Returns None if the input list is empty or contains only empty lists.
    """

    heap = []

    # Push the head of each non-empty list onto the heap.
    for i in range(len(lists)):
        if lists[i]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, lists[i])

    # Create a dummy node to start the merged list.
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    tail = dummy

    # While the heap is not empty, pop the smallest node, add it to the merged list,
    # and push the next node from that list onto the heap.
    while heap:
        node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        tail.next = node
        tail = tail.next

        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, node.next)

    return dummy.next

# Example Usage and Testing
def create_linked_list(arr):
    """Helper function to create a linked list from an array."""
    if not arr:
        return None
    head = ListNode(arr[0])
    curr = head
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        curr.next = ListNode(arr[i])
        curr = curr.next
    return head

def linked_list_to_array(head):
    """Helper function to convert a linked list to an array."""
    result = []
    curr = head
    while curr:
        result.append(curr.val)
        curr = curr.next
    return result

# Example Input
lists = [
    create_linked_list([1, 4, 5]),
    create_linked_list([1, 3, 4]),
    create_linked_list([2, 6])
]

# Merge the lists
merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

# Convert the merged list to an array for easy verification
merged_array = linked_list_to_array(merged_list)

# Print the merged array
print(merged_array) # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]

# Test case with empty lists
lists2 = [None, create_linked_list([1]), None]
merged_list2 = mergeKLists(lists2)
merged_array2 = linked_list_to_array(merged_list2)
print(merged_array2)  # Output: [1]

lists3 = []
merged_list3 = mergeKLists(lists3)
merged_array3 = linked_list_to_array(merged_list3)
print(merged_array3)  # Output: []

lists4 = [None, None]
merged_list4 = mergeKLists(lists4)
merged_array4 = linked_list_to_array(merged_list4)
print(merged_array4) # Output []
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ListNode` Class:** Defines the structure for a node in a singly linked list.  Crucially, the `__lt__` method is implemented in the `ListNode` class. This is *essential* for using `heapq` directly with `ListNode` objects.  `heapq` needs to be able to compare nodes to maintain the heap property.

2.  **`mergeKLists(lists)` Function:**

    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `heap`: A min-heap (priority queue) that stores the head nodes of the linked lists. We use `heapq` from the Python standard library for heap operations.
        *   `dummy`: A dummy node to simplify the construction of the merged linked list. It's a common technique to avoid special cases at the beginning.
        *   `tail`:  A pointer to the last node of the merged linked list.

    *   **Populate Heap:**
        *   The code iterates through the input `lists`.  For each linked list in `lists`, if the list is *not* empty (i.e., the head node is not `None`), the head node is pushed onto the min-heap.

    *   **Merge Loop:**
        *   The `while heap:` loop continues as long as there are nodes in the heap.
        *   `heapq.heappop(heap)`:  Removes the node with the smallest value from the heap. This is the next node to be added to the merged list.
        *   `tail.next = node`:  Appends the smallest node to the merged list.
        *   `tail = tail.next`:  Moves the `tail` pointer to the newly added node.
        *   `if node.next:`: If the node that was just added to the merged list has a `next` node (i.e., there are more nodes in its original linked list), then that `next` node is pushed onto the heap.  This ensures that the heap always contains the next smallest available nodes from all the lists.

    *   **Return Result:**
        *   `dummy.next`:  Returns the head of the merged linked list (skipping the dummy node).

3.  **Helper Functions (for testing):**

    *   `create_linked_list(arr)`: Converts a Python list into a linked list.
    *   `linked_list_to_array(head)`: Converts a linked list into a Python list. These are used for easily creating test cases and verifying the output.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all the linked lists, and k is the number of linked lists.  Each node is pushed onto and popped from the heap once. The heap operations take O(log k) time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of linked lists. This is the space used by the min-heap to store the head nodes. The space used by the output list is not considered extra space.
**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

*   **`__lt__` in `ListNode`:** This is *crucially important*. The `heapq` module relies on the `<` operator to compare elements and maintain the heap property. Without defining `__lt__` in the `ListNode` class, you'll get a `TypeError` when `heapq` tries to compare `ListNode` objects.

*   **Handles Empty Lists Gracefully:** The code explicitly checks for empty lists (`if lists[i]:`) before pushing nodes onto the heap.  This prevents errors and ensures the code works correctly even if some of the input lists are empty.  The final test cases I added specifically address this scenario.

*   **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive variable names like `dummy` and `tail` improve readability.

*   **Comprehensive Example:** The example usage includes helper functions to create linked lists from arrays and convert them back.  This makes it easier to test the code and verify its correctness.

*   **Complete and Executable:**  This is a full, runnable Python program, making it easy to copy, paste, and test.
