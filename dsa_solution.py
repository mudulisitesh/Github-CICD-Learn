Okay, here's a DSA problem along with a Python solution.

**Problem: Minimum Window Substring**

Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`. If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return the empty string "".

**Example:**

*   `s = "ADOBECODEBANC"`
*   `t = "ABC"`

*   **Output:** `"BANC"`

**Explanation:**

The minimum window in `s` that contains all characters of `t` is "BANC".

**Python Code Solution:**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def min_window(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    """
    Finds the minimum window in s which contains all characters in t.

    Args:
        s: The source string.
        t: The target string (characters to cover).

    Returns:
        The minimum window substring, or "" if no such window exists.
    """

    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    need = defaultdict(int)  # Counts of characters needed from t
    for char in t:
        need[char] += 1

    have = defaultdict(int)  # Counts of characters in current window
    required = len(need)  # Number of unique characters needed
    formed = 0  # Number of unique characters in window matching need

    left = 0
    right = 0
    min_len = float('inf')
    min_start = 0  # Start index of the minimum window

    while right < len(s):
        char = s[right]
        have[char] += 1

        if char in need and have[char] == need[char]:
            formed += 1

        while left <= right and formed == required:
            # Window is valid, try to shrink it
            if (right - left + 1) < min_len:
                min_len = (right - left + 1)
                min_start = left

            char = s[left]
            have[char] -= 1

            if char in need and have[char] < need[char]:
                formed -= 1

            left += 1

        right += 1

    if min_len == float('inf'):
        return ""
    else:
        return s[min_start:min_start + min_len]

# Example Usage:
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(f"Minimum window substring: {result}")  # Output: BANC

s = "a"
t = "aa"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(f"Minimum window substring: {result}") # Output: ""
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**

    *   `need`: A `defaultdict` to store the frequency of each character in `t`. This represents what we *need* to find in `s`.
    *   `have`: A `defaultdict` to store the frequency of characters in the current window of `s`.
    *   `required`: The number of unique characters in `t`.
    *   `formed`: The number of unique characters in the current window that have reached the required frequency as defined in `need`.
    *   `left`, `right`: Pointers to the left and right boundaries of the sliding window.
    *   `min_len`: Initialized to infinity. Stores the minimum window length found so far.
    *   `min_start`: Stores the starting index of the minimum window.

2.  **Sliding Window:**

    *   The `while right < len(s)` loop expands the window by moving the `right` pointer.
    *   For each character added to the window (`s[right]`), its count is updated in the `have` dictionary.
    *   If the added character is in `need` and its frequency in `have` now matches its frequency in `need`, `formed` is incremented.  This means we've met the requirement for that character.

3.  **Shrinking the Window:**

    *   The `while left <= right and formed == required` loop shrinks the window from the left as long as the current window is a valid window (i.e., contains all required characters).
    *   Inside this loop, we check if the current window length (`right - left + 1`) is smaller than `min_len`. If so, we update `min_len` and `min_start`.
    *   We then remove the character at the left end of the window (`s[left]`) from `have` and increment `left`.
    *   If removing this character makes the frequency of that character in `have` less than what's required in `need`, we decrement `formed` because the window is no longer guaranteed to contain all characters from `t`.

4.  **Result:**

    *   If `min_len` is still infinity after the entire string `s` has been traversed, it means no valid window was found. In this case, we return "".
    *   Otherwise, we return the substring of `s` from `min_start` to `min_start + min_len`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where n is the length of string `s` and m is the length of string `t`.  The `while` loops can run up to `n` times, and the `for` loop to create `need` runs `m` times.
**Space Complexity:** O(m), where m is the number of unique characters in string `t`.  This is the space used by the `need` and `have` dictionaries.  In the worst case, `t` could contain all unique characters, and `need` would store them all.
