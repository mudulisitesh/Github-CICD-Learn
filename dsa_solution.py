Okay, here's a random DSA problem along with a Python solution.

**Problem:**

**Merge Intervals**

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example:**

*   **Input:** `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
*   **Output:** `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

**Explanation:**

Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, merge them into `[1,6]`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= intervals[i][0] <= intervals[i][1] <= 10^4`

**Python Solution:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two integers
                   representing the start and end points.

    Returns:
        A list of merged intervals.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals based on their start times.  Crucial step!
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
        # interval does not overlap with the last interval, simply append it.
        if not merged or interval[0] > merged[-1][1]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current interval
            # with the last interval.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

    return merged

# Example Usage:
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
merged_intervals = merge_intervals(intervals)
print(f"Original Intervals: {intervals}")
print(f"Merged Intervals: {merged_intervals}")

intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
merged_intervals = merge_intervals(intervals)
print(f"Original Intervals: {intervals}")
print(f"Merged Intervals: {merged_intervals}")

intervals = [[1,4],[0,4]]
merged_intervals = merge_intervals(intervals)
print(f"Original Intervals: {intervals}")
print(f"Merged Intervals: {merged_intervals}")

intervals = [[1,4],[0,0]]
merged_intervals = merge_intervals(intervals)
print(f"Original Intervals: {intervals}")
print(f"Merged Intervals: {merged_intervals}")
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Handle Empty Input:** The code first checks if the input list `intervals` is empty. If it is, an empty list is returned.

2.  **Sort Intervals:** The crucial step is to sort the intervals based on their start times using `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])`. This sorting ensures that we can iterate through the intervals in ascending order of their start times, making it easier to identify and merge overlapping intervals.

3.  **Iterate and Merge:** The code iterates through the sorted intervals. For each interval, it checks if it overlaps with the last interval added to the `merged` list.

    *   **No Overlap:** If the `merged` list is empty or if the current interval's start time is greater than the end time of the last interval in `merged`, it means there's no overlap.  In this case, the current interval is simply appended to the `merged` list.

    *   **Overlap:** If there's overlap (i.e., `interval[0] <= merged[-1][1]`), the end time of the last interval in `merged` is updated to be the maximum of its current end time and the end time of the current interval.  This effectively merges the two overlapping intervals.

4.  **Return Merged Intervals:** Finally, the `merged` list, containing the merged intervals, is returned.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The rest of the algorithm takes O(n) time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where no intervals overlap, and the `merged` list contains all the original intervals. In the best case (all intervals merge into one), the space complexity is O(1).

**Key Concepts Used:**

*   **Sorting:** Sorting the intervals by start time is essential for efficiently identifying overlaps.
*   **Greedy Approach:** The algorithm makes locally optimal choices (merging intervals whenever possible) to arrive at the globally optimal solution.
*   **List Manipulation:** The code uses list operations like `append()` and indexing (`merged[-1]`) to build and update the merged intervals.
