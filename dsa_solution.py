Okay, here's a DSA problem with a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge Overlapping Intervals**

Given a list of intervals, where each interval is represented by a start and end time, merge all overlapping intervals and return a list of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

For example:

Input: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

Explanation: `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so merge them into `[1,6]`.

Another example:

Input: `[[1,4],[4,5]]`
Output: `[[1,5]]`

Explanation:  `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping.

**Python Code Solution:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list [start, end].

    Returns:
        A list of non-overlapping intervals.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals based on their start times. This is crucial.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
        # interval does not overlap with the last interval, append it.
        if not merged or interval[0] > merged[-1][1]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous
            # intervals. We take the maximum of the end times.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

    return merged

# Example Usage
intervals1 = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
print(f"Input: {intervals1}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals1)}")  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
print(f"Input: {intervals2}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals2)}")  # Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
print(f"Input: {intervals3}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals3)}") # Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
print(f"Input: {intervals4}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals4)}") # Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]

intervals5 = [[1,4],[0,2],[3,5]]
print(f"Input: {intervals5}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals5)}") # Output: [[0, 5]]

intervals6 = [[1,4],[0,5]]
print(f"Input: {intervals6}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals6)}") # Output: [[0, 5]]

intervals7 = [[1,4],[2,3]]
print(f"Input: {intervals7}, Merged: {merge_intervals(intervals7)}") # Output: [[1, 4]]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Sort the Intervals:** The most important step is to sort the intervals based on their start times. This ensures that we process the intervals in the correct order to identify overlaps effectively.  We use `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` to sort the list in place. The `key=lambda x: x[0]` specifies that we should sort based on the first element of each interval (the start time).

2.  **Iterate and Merge:**
    *   We iterate through the sorted intervals.
    *   `merged`: This list stores the merged intervals that we build up.
    *   If the `merged` list is empty or the current interval doesn't overlap with the last interval in `merged` (i.e., `interval[0] > merged[-1][1]`), we simply append the current interval to `merged`.
    *   If the current interval *does* overlap with the last interval in `merged`, we merge them.  Specifically, we update the end time of the last interval in `merged` to be the maximum of the two end times (`merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])`).

3.  **Return the Result:** Finally, we return the `merged` list, which contains the non-overlapping intervals that cover the entire range of the input intervals.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n log n):  The dominant factor is the sorting of the intervals, which typically takes O(n log n) time. The iteration and merging are O(n).

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(n) in the worst case, where no intervals overlap, and the `merged` list stores all the original intervals.  In the best case (significant overlap), the space complexity can be less than O(n).
