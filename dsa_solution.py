Okay, here's a problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays**

Given two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, write a function to compute their intersection. The intersection should include only unique elements, and the order of the elements in the result does not matter.

**Example:**

```
nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
nums2 = [2, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]

Output: [2, 4]
```

**Python Solution:**

```python
def intersection_sorted(nums1, nums2):
    """
    Finds the intersection of two sorted arrays, returning unique elements.

    Args:
        nums1: The first sorted array.
        nums2: The second sorted array.

    Returns:
        A list containing the unique elements in the intersection of nums1 and nums2.
    """

    result = set() # Use a set to automatically handle uniqueness
    i = 0
    j = 0

    while i < len(nums1) and j < len(nums2):
        if nums1[i] < nums2[j]:
            i += 1
        elif nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
            j += 1
        else:
            result.add(nums1[i])  # Or result.add(nums2[j]), they are equal
            i += 1
            j += 1

    return list(result)


# Example usage:
nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
nums2 = [2, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
intersection = intersection_sorted(nums1, nums2)
print(f"Intersection: {intersection}") # Output: Intersection: [2, 4]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `result`:  A `set` is used to store the intersection elements.  Sets inherently ensure that only unique elements are stored.  Using a set provides O(1) average time complexity for adding elements and checking for existence, making the overall process more efficient.
   - `i`, `j`: Pointers to iterate through `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

2. **Two Pointers Approach:**
   - The `while` loop continues as long as both pointers `i` and `j` are within the bounds of their respective arrays.
   - **Comparison:**
     - If `nums1[i] < nums2[j]`, it means the current element in `nums1` is smaller than the current element in `nums2`.  So, we increment `i` to move to the next potentially larger element in `nums1`.
     - If `nums1[i] > nums2[j]`, we increment `j` to move to the next potentially larger element in `nums2`.
     - If `nums1[i] == nums2[j]`, it means we've found a common element (an element in the intersection).  We add this element to the `result` set (it will only be added once due to the set's properties).  Then, we increment both `i` and `j` to move to the next elements in both arrays.

3. **Return:**
   - Finally, the `set` `result` is converted to a `list` and returned.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(m + n), where `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`.  This is because we are iterating through both arrays at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(m, n)) in the worst case, where all elements of the shorter array are present in the longer array. This is due to the space used by the `result` set. In the best case, if there are no common elements, the space complexity is O(1).

**Why this is a good DSA problem:**

*   **Requires Understanding of Sorted Arrays:**  The optimal solution leverages the fact that the input arrays are sorted.
*   **Two Pointers Technique:** This is a classic algorithm pattern that is often used when working with sorted arrays or linked lists.
*   **Set Usage:**  Demonstrates how to use a set to efficiently ensure uniqueness.
*   **Time Complexity Analysis:** Forces the candidate to think about the efficiency of the algorithm.
*   **Code Clarity:**  Encourages writing clear, concise, and readable code.
