Okay, here's a DSA problem, along with a clear explanation and a working Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge Intervals**

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example 1:**

Input: `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
Explanation: Since intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, merge them into `[1,6]`.

**Example 2:**

Input: `intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`
Output: `[[1,5]]`
Explanation: Intervals `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= intervals[i][0] <= intervals[i][1] <= 10^4`

**Explanation:**

The core idea is:

1.  **Sort:** Sort the intervals based on their starting points.  This makes it easy to process them sequentially.

2.  **Iterate and Merge:**  Iterate through the sorted intervals.  Keep track of the `merged` intervals.  For each interval:

    *   If the current interval overlaps with the last interval in `merged`, merge them by updating the end of the last interval in `merged` to be the maximum of the two interval ends.
    *   If they don't overlap, simply append the current interval to `merged`.

**Python Code:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two integers [start, end].

    Returns:
        A list of merged intervals.
    """

    # Sort the intervals by their starting points
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
        # interval does not overlap with the last interval, simply append it.
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and last intervals.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

    return merged

# Example usage:
intervals1 = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals1}: {merge_intervals(intervals1)}")  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals2}: {merge_intervals(intervals2)}")  # Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals3}: {merge_intervals(intervals3)}") # Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals4}: {merge_intervals(intervals4)}") # Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]

intervals5 = [[1,4],[0,2],[3,5]]
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals5}: {merge_intervals(intervals5)}") # Output: [[0, 5]]
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`merge_intervals(intervals)` function:**
    *   Takes a list of `intervals` as input.
    *   Sorts the intervals using `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])`. The `key=lambda x: x[0]` part specifies that the sorting should be based on the first element (the start time) of each interval.
    *   Initializes an empty list called `merged` to store the merged intervals.
    *   Iterates through the sorted `intervals`.
    *   **Overlap Check:**
        *   `if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:`  This checks if either the `merged` list is empty (meaning we're processing the first interval) or if the end time of the last interval in `merged` is less than the start time of the current interval. If either of these is true, it means there's no overlap.
        *   `merged[-1][1] < interval[0]` : `merged[-1]` accesses the last interval added to the `merged` list. `merged[-1][1]` accesses the *end* of that last interval. `interval[0]` accesses the *start* of the current interval being considered. If the end of the last merged interval is before the start of the current interval, they don't overlap.
    *   **No Overlap:** If there's no overlap, `merged.append(interval)` simply adds the current interval to the `merged` list.
    *   **Overlap:**
        *   `else:`  If the `if` condition is false, it means there's overlap.
        *   `merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])` This line updates the end time of the last interval in `merged`. It takes the maximum of the current end time of the last merged interval and the end time of the current interval.  This ensures the merged interval covers the entire range of both original intervals.
    *   Finally, `return merged` returns the list of merged intervals.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The iteration and merging are O(n), but the sorting dominates.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case if there are no overlapping intervals, as we would store all `n` intervals in the `merged` list.  In the best case (all intervals overlap and are merged into a single interval), the space complexity would be O(1).  The sorting algorithm may also require additional space depending on the implementation.
