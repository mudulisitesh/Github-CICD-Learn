Okay, here's a random DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**"Merge Intervals"**

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example 1:**

Input: `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
Explanation: Since intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, merge them into `[1,6]`.

**Example 2:**

Input: `intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`
Output: `[[1,5]]`
Explanation: Intervals `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= intervals[i][0] <= intervals[i][1] <= 104`

**Python Solution:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two integers (start, end).

    Returns:
        A list of merged intervals.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals by start time. This is crucial for the algorithm's correctness.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
        # interval does not overlap with the last interval, simply append it.
        if not merged or interval[0] > merged[-1][1]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current interval
            # with the last interval.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

    return merged

# Example Usage:
intervals1 = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
print(f"Input: {intervals1}, Output: {merge_intervals(intervals1)}")  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
print(f"Input: {intervals2}, Output: {merge_intervals(intervals2)}")  # Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
print(f"Input: {intervals3}, Output: {merge_intervals(intervals3)}") #Output [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
print(f"Input: {intervals4}, Output: {merge_intervals(intervals4)}") # Output [[0, 0], [1, 4]]

intervals5 = [[1,4],[0,2],[3,5]]
print(f"Input: {intervals5}, Output: {merge_intervals(intervals5)}") # Output [[0, 5]]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Sort Intervals:** The core idea is to sort the intervals based on their starting times. This allows us to iterate through them sequentially and check for overlaps.

2.  **Iterate and Merge:**
    *   Initialize an empty `merged` list to store the merged intervals.
    *   For each interval:
        *   If `merged` is empty or the current interval's start is greater than the end of the last interval in `merged`, it means there's no overlap. Add the current interval directly to `merged`.
        *   Otherwise, there's an overlap.  Update the end of the last interval in `merged` to be the maximum of its current end and the current interval's end.  This effectively merges the intervals.

3.  **Return:**  Return the `merged` list.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The rest of the algorithm is O(n).

**Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case (if no intervals overlap, the `merged` list will store all intervals). It could be considered O(1) extra space if you're allowed to modify the input array in place (in some scenarios, you might sort in-place and modify the original list). However, a new `merged` list is created here for clarity.
