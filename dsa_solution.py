Okay, here's a problem involving a graph traversal and a working Python solution:

**Problem: Islands in a Grid (Connected Components)**

You are given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water).  An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).  Count the number of islands in the grid.

**Example:**

```
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]

Output: 1
```

```
grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]

Output: 3
```

**Explanation:**

The key idea is to traverse the grid.  When you find a '1', you've found the start of an island.  Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the entire connected component of that island, marking all visited '1's as visited (e.g., by changing them to '0's). Each time you start a new DFS/BFS from an unvisited '1', you've found a new island.

**Python Solution (DFS):**

```python
def num_islands(grid):
    """
    Counts the number of islands in a 2D grid.

    Args:
        grid: A list of lists of strings, representing the grid.

    Returns:
        The number of islands in the grid.
    """

    if not grid:
        return 0

    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    num_islands = 0

    def dfs(row, col):
        """Performs Depth-First Search to mark an island as visited."""
        if row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or grid[row][col] == '0':
            return

        # Mark as visited by changing to '0'
        grid[row][col] = '0'

        # Explore adjacent cells
        dfs(row + 1, col)  # Down
        dfs(row - 1, col)  # Up
        dfs(row, col + 1)  # Right
        dfs(row, col - 1)  # Left

    for row in range(rows):
        for col in range(cols):
            if grid[row][col] == '1':
                num_islands += 1
                dfs(row, col)

    return num_islands

# Example Usage:
grid1 = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
print(f"Number of islands in grid1: {num_islands(grid1)}")  # Output: 1

grid2 = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
print(f"Number of islands in grid2: {num_islands(grid2)}")  # Output: 3

grid3 = [
    ["1","0","1","0","1"]
]

print(f"Number of islands in grid3: {num_islands(grid3)}") # Output: 3
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`num_islands(grid)`:**
    *   Checks for an empty grid.
    *   Gets the number of rows and columns.
    *   Initializes `num_islands` to 0.
    *   Iterates through each cell in the grid.
    *   If a cell is '1', it increments `num_islands` and calls `dfs()` to explore the island.

2.  **`dfs(row, col)`:**
    *   **Base Case:**  Checks if the current cell is out of bounds or is water ('0'). If so, it returns.
    *   **Mark as Visited:** Sets the current cell to '0' (water) to prevent revisiting it and causing infinite recursion.
    *   **Recursive Calls:**  Recursively calls `dfs()` on the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(M \* N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid.  We visit each cell at most once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(M \* N) in the worst case due to the recursion stack in DFS. This happens when the entire grid is filled with '1's, and the DFS will potentially explore the entire grid. In the best case(when the grid is filled with waters), the space complexity is O(1).

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Graph Traversal:** The grid can be thought of as a graph where each '1' is a node and adjacent '1's have edges between them.
*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):** A common algorithm for exploring graphs.
*   **Connected Components:**  A set of vertices in a graph that are reachable from each other.  Each island is a connected component.
*   **In-Place Modification:**  The code modifies the grid in place by changing '1's to '0's to mark them as visited.  If you need to preserve the original grid, you would need to create a separate `visited` matrix.

This solution efficiently counts the number of islands by using DFS to explore and mark each connected island as visited. Remember that you could also use BFS instead of DFS to solve this problem.  The logic would be similar.
