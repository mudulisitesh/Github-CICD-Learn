Okay, here's a problem and a Python solution.

**Problem:  Minimum Window Substring**

**Description:**

Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t` in complexity O(n). If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return the empty string "".

**Example:**

```
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"

Output: "BANC"
```

**Explanation:**

The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from the string `t`.
**Python Solution:**

```python
def min_window(s, t):
    """
    Finds the minimum window substring of s that contains all characters of t.

    Args:
        s: The string to search within.
        t: The string containing the characters to find.

    Returns:
        The minimum window substring of s that contains all characters of t,
        or an empty string if no such window exists.
    """

    if not t or not s:
        return ""

    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of characters in t
    dict_t = {}
    for char in t:
        dict_t[char] = dict_t.get(char, 0) + 1

    # Number of unique characters in t that we need to find in s
    required = len(dict_t)

    # Left and right pointers to form the sliding window
    l, r = 0, 0

    # formed is used to keep track of how many unique characters in t
    # are present in the current window in its desired frequency.
    # e.g. if t is "AABC" then the window must have two A's.
    formed = 0

    # Dictionary to store the frequency of characters in the current window
    window_counts = {}

    # ans tuple of the form (window length, left, right)
    ans = float('inf'), None, None

    while r < len(s):
        character = s[r]
        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1

        if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] == dict_t[character]:
            formed += 1

        # Try and contract the window till the point where it ceases to be 'desirable'
        while l <= r and formed == required:
            character = s[l]

            # Save the smallest window until now.
            if r - l + 1 < ans[0]:
                ans = (r - l + 1, l, r)

            # The character at the left pointer is no longer a part of the window
            window_counts[character] -= 1
            if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] < dict_t[character]:
                formed -= 1

            # Move the left pointer ahead, this would help to look for a new window.
            l += 1

        # Keep expanding the window once we are done contracting.
        r += 1

    return "" if ans[0] == float('inf') else s[ans[1] : ans[2] + 1]
# Example Usage
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(f"Minimum window substring: {result}")  # Output: BANC

s = "a"
t = "a"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(f"Minimum window substring: {result}") # Output: a

s = "a"
t = "aa"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(f"Minimum window substring: {result}") # Output: ""
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `dict_t`:  Stores the frequency of each character in the target string `t`.
   - `required`:  The number of unique characters in `t`.
   - `l`, `r`: Left and right pointers of the sliding window.
   - `formed`:  Keeps track of how many characters from `t` have been found in the current window with the required frequency.
   - `window_counts`: Stores the frequency of each character in the current window.
   - `ans`: Stores the result (window length, start index, end index).  Initialized to `(infinity, None, None)`.

2. **Sliding Window:**
   - The `while r < len(s)` loop expands the window by moving the `r` (right) pointer.
   - The current character `s[r]` is added to the `window_counts`.
   - If the frequency of `s[r]` in `window_counts` now matches its frequency in `dict_t`, increment `formed`.

3. **Contracting the Window:**
   - The `while l <= r and formed == required` loop contracts the window by moving the `l` (left) pointer.  This happens when the current window contains all characters from `t` with sufficient frequency.
   - Inside this loop:
     - Check if the current window's length is smaller than the smallest window found so far (`ans`). If yes, update `ans`.
     - Remove the character `s[l]` from the window by decrementing its count in `window_counts`.
     - If `s[l]` is a character from `t` and its frequency in the window becomes less than its frequency in `dict_t`, decrement `formed`.
     - Move the left pointer `l` one position to the right.

4. **Return Value:**
   - If `ans[0]` is still `infinity`, it means no valid window was found, so return an empty string.
   - Otherwise, return the substring of `s` from `ans[1]` to `ans[2] + 1`, which is the minimum window.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of string `s`.  Both the left and right pointers traverse the string at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m), where m is the number of unique characters in string `t`.  This is because we store the frequency of characters in `dict_t` and `window_counts`.  In the worst case, all characters in `t` could be unique.  The `window_counts` dictionary can also hold up to `n` characters in the worst case (when all characters in `s` are different). However, in many cases, `m` will be much smaller than `n`.

This solution satisfies the O(n) time complexity requirement.
