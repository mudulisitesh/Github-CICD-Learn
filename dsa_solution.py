Okay, here's a DSA problem, along with a Python solution, including explanations:

**Problem: Find the Missing Number**

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

**Example:**

*   `nums = [3, 0, 1]`
*   Output: `2`
*   Explanation: `n = 3` since there are 3 numbers. All numbers are in the range `[0, 3]`. `2` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

*   `nums = [0, 1]`
*   Output: `2`
*   Explanation: `n = 2` since there are 2 numbers. All numbers are in the range `[0, 2]`. `2` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

*   `nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]`
*   Output: `8`
*   Explanation: `n = 9` since there are 9 numbers. All numbers are in the range `[0, 9]`. `8` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the numbers of `nums` are unique.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def missingNumber(nums):
    """
    Finds the missing number in a sequence of numbers from 0 to n.

    Args:
        nums: A list of integers in the range [0, n].

    Returns:
        The missing number in the range [0, n].
    """
    n = len(nums)
    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Sum of numbers from 0 to n
    actual_sum = sum(nums)
    return expected_sum - actual_sum

# Example usage:
nums1 = [3, 0, 1]
print(f"Missing number in {nums1}: {missingNumber(nums1)}")  # Output: 2

nums2 = [0, 1]
print(f"Missing number in {nums2}: {missingNumber(nums2)}")  # Output: 2

nums3 = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
print(f"Missing number in {nums3}: {missingNumber(nums3)}")  # Output: 8
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Expected Sum:** The sum of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) can be efficiently calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2`. This is based on the arithmetic series sum formula.

2.  **Calculate Actual Sum:**  Calculate the sum of the numbers present in the input array `nums`.

3.  **Find the Difference:** The difference between the `expected_sum` and the `actual_sum` is the missing number. This is because the `expected_sum` represents the sum if all numbers from 0 to `n` were present, and `actual_sum` only contains the sum of numbers that *are* present.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `nums` array. We iterate through the array once to calculate the sum.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1), constant extra space. We are only using a few variables to store sums and the length of the array.  We don't use any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

**Why this is a good approach:**

*   **Efficient:**  It avoids sorting or using sets, which would have a higher time complexity in general.  The arithmetic sum formula allows us to calculate the expected sum in O(1) time.
*   **Concise:** The code is relatively short and easy to understand.
*   **Correct:** It handles all valid input cases according to the problem statement.
