Okay, here's a random DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:  Merge K Sorted Linked Lists**

You are given an array of k linked-lists, each sorted in ascending order.  Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

Input:
```
lists = [
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
```

Output:
```
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Python Solution using a Heap (Priority Queue)**

```python
import heapq

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists):
    """
    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

    Args:
        lists: A list of ListNode heads representing the k sorted lists.

    Returns:
        The head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """

    # Use a min-heap to efficiently track the smallest element across all lists
    heap = []  # Store (value, list_index) tuples in the heap

    # Initialize the heap with the first element from each non-empty list
    for i in range(len(lists)):
        if lists[i]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i))  # (value, list_index)

    # Create a dummy node to simplify building the merged list
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy  # Points to the current tail of the merged list

    while heap:
        val, list_index = heapq.heappop(heap)  # Get smallest value and its list
        current.next = ListNode(val)          # Add it to the merged list
        current = current.next                # Move the tail pointer

        # Advance the list from which the smallest value came
        lists[list_index] = lists[list_index].next

        # If the list still has elements, add the next one to the heap
        if lists[list_index]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[list_index].val, list_index))

    return dummy.next  # Return the head of the merged list (after the dummy)

# Example usage:

# Create the linked lists from the example input
list1 = ListNode(1, ListNode(4, ListNode(5)))
list2 = ListNode(1, ListNode(3, ListNode(4)))
list3 = ListNode(2, ListNode(6))

lists = [list1, list2, list3]

# Merge the lists
merged_list = mergeKLists(lists)

# Print the merged list (for demonstration)
def print_list(head):
    elements = []
    while head:
        elements.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    print("->".join(map(str, elements)))  #Concatenating and formatting using map
    
print_list(merged_list) # Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **ListNode Class:** Explicitly defines the `ListNode` class for clarity. This is fundamental when working with linked lists.
* **Heap (Priority Queue):**  Uses `heapq` to implement a min-heap.  The heap stores tuples of `(value, list_index)`.  `value` is the value of the node, and `list_index` is the index of the list from which that node came. This is crucial for knowing which list to advance from when a node is processed. The `heapq` module ensures that the smallest value is always at the top, making it efficient to find the next smallest element across all lists.  Python's `heapq` works on tuples, automatically comparing them element-wise.
* **Dummy Node:**  A `dummy` node is created at the beginning. This simplifies the code because you don't have to handle the special case of the first node separately.  The `dummy` node is then discarded when returning the merged list.
* **Clearer Logic:** The `while heap:` loop continues as long as there are elements in the heap (meaning there are still nodes to process in at least one of the linked lists).
* **List Index Tracking:**  The `list_index` is stored in the heap along with the value.  After popping the smallest value, we use `list_index` to access the correct list and advance to the next node in that list.
* **Handling Empty Lists:** The code correctly handles cases where one or more of the input lists might be empty. The initial loop skips empty lists.
* **Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining each step of the algorithm.
* **`print_list` function:**  A helper function is added to print the linked list so that you can easily see the output of the algorithm. Using `map(str, elements)` is more Pythonic for converting list elements to strings for joining.
* **Conciseness:** The code is written concisely and efficiently.

**How it works:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - A min-heap is created to store nodes from all the lists.  The heap stores `(value, list_index)` tuples.
   - A dummy node is created to simplify building the merged list.
2. **Populate the Heap:** The code iterates through the input `lists` and adds the first node from each non-empty list to the heap.  Critically, it stores the list's index with the node's value.
3. **Merging:**
   - While the heap is not empty:
     - The smallest element (with its list index) is popped from the heap.
     - A new node is created with the smallest value and appended to the merged list.
     - The list from which the smallest value came is advanced to its next node.
     - If the list still has elements, the next node (with its list index) is added to the heap.
4. **Return:** The `next` pointer of the dummy node is returned, which is the head of the merged sorted list.

**Time Complexity:**  O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all the lists, and k is the number of lists. The heap operations (push and pop) take O(log k) time, and we perform N heap operations.

**Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of linked lists. This is the space used by the min-heap to store at most one element from each list.  The space for the output linked list is not considered.
