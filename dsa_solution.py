Okay, here's a DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Minimum Window Substring with Required Characters**

Given a string `s` and a string `t`, find the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`.  If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return the empty string "".

The characters of `t` can appear multiple times in the window.

**Example:**

```
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"

Output: "BANC"
```

**Explanation:**

The minimum window substring "BANC" contains all the characters 'A', 'B', and 'C' from the string `t`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
*   `1 <= t.length <= 10^5`
*   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

**Python Code Solution:**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def min_window(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    """
    Finds the minimum window substring in 's' that contains all characters in 't'.

    Args:
        s: The input string.
        t: The string containing required characters.

    Returns:
        The minimum window substring in 's' that contains all characters in 't',
        or an empty string if no such window exists.
    """

    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    need = defaultdict(int)  # Characters in t and their counts
    for char in t:
        need[char] += 1

    window = defaultdict(int) # Characters in current window and their counts
    have = 0 # How many characters from t are present in window with correct frequency
    required = len(need) # total number of unique characters we need

    left = 0
    min_len = float('inf')
    start = 0  # Start index of the minimum window

    for right in range(len(s)):
        char = s[right]
        window[char] += 1

        if char in need and window[char] == need[char]:
            have += 1

        while have == required:
            if (right - left + 1) < min_len:
                min_len = (right - left + 1)
                start = left

            char_left = s[left]
            window[char_left] -= 1

            if char_left in need and window[char_left] < need[char_left]:
                have -= 1

            left += 1

    if min_len == float('inf'):
        return ""

    return s[start : start + min_len]


# Example Usage
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(result)  # Output: BANC

s = "a"
t = "aa"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(result) # Output: ""

s = "abc"
t = "cba"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(result) # Output: abc

s = "bbaac"
t = "aba"
result = min_window(s, t)
print(result) # Output: baac
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`need` Dictionary:** Stores the frequency of each character in the string `t`.  This tells us what characters and how many of each we need to find in the window.

2.  **`window` Dictionary:** Stores the frequency of each character in the current window of `s`.

3.  **`have` Variable:** Keeps track of how many characters in the `window` have the required frequencies as defined in the `need` dictionary.  It increases only when a character's count in the window reaches the required count in `need`.

4.  **`required` Variable:** The number of unique characters we need to find, based on the length of the `need` dictionary.

5.  **Sliding Window:**
    *   The `right` pointer expands the window.  For each character encountered, the `window` count is updated. If the character is in `need` and its count in `window` has reached its required count from `need`, then `have` is incremented.
    *   The `while` loop shrinks the window from the `left` as long as `have == required`. Inside the while loop:
        *   We check if the current window size is smaller than the current `min_len`. If it is, we update `min_len` and `start` to keep track of the smallest window found so far.
        *   We decrement the count of the leftmost character in the `window`.
        *   If the leftmost character is in `need` and its count in `window` falls below its required count, we decrement `have`.
        *   Finally, we move the `left` pointer to the right.

6.  **Return Value:**  After the loop finishes, if `min_len` is still `float('inf')`, it means no valid window was found, so we return "". Otherwise, we return the substring of `s` starting at `start` with length `min_len`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where n is the length of string `s` and m is the length of string `t`. In the worst case, the `right` pointer iterates through `s` once, and the `left` pointer might also iterate through `s` once, so the time complexity is proportional to the length of `s`. The creation of `need` dictionary is proportional to the length of `t`.

**Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in `t`.  In the worst case, `k` could be equal to the size of the alphabet.  The space used by `need` and `window` dictionaries depends on the number of unique characters present in `t` and in the current window of `s`.
