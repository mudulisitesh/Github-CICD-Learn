Okay, here's a DSA problem and a Python solution:

**Problem:**

**Merge Intervals**

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example:**

*   **Input:** `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
*   **Output:** `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
*   **Explanation:** Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they merge to `[1,6]`.

*   **Input:** `intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`
*   **Output:** `[[1,5]]`
*   **Explanation:** Intervals `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping.

**Python Solution:**

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

    Args:
      intervals: A list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two integers [start, end].

    Returns:
      A list of merged intervals.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort the intervals based on the start time.  This is crucial for efficiency.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the merged list is empty or the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in the merged list
        if not merged or interval[0] > merged[-1][1]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Overlap found, update the end of the last merged interval if necessary
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

    return merged

# Example Usage:
intervals1 = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals1}: {merge_intervals(intervals1)}")  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

intervals2 = [[1,4],[4,5]]
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals2}: {merge_intervals(intervals2)}")  # Output: [[1, 5]]

intervals3 = [[1,4],[0,4]]
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals3}: {merge_intervals(intervals3)}")  # Output: [[0, 4]]

intervals4 = [[1,4],[0,0]]
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals4}: {merge_intervals(intervals4)}") # Output: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]

intervals5 = [[1,4],[0,2],[3,5]]
print(f"Merged intervals for {intervals5}: {merge_intervals(intervals5)}") # Output: [[0, 5]]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Sort Intervals:** The key step is to sort the intervals based on their starting points. This allows us to process them in a sequential manner and efficiently check for overlaps. The `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])` line does this, using a lambda function as the sorting key to specify that we want to sort based on the first element of each interval (the start time).

2.  **Iterate and Merge:**
    *   We initialize an empty `merged` list to store the resulting merged intervals.
    *   We iterate through the sorted `intervals`.
    *   **No Overlap:** If the `merged` list is empty (first interval) or the current interval's start time is greater than the end time of the last interval in `merged` (no overlap), we simply append the current interval to `merged`.
    *   **Overlap:** If there's an overlap (current interval's start time is less than or equal to the end time of the last interval in `merged`), we update the end time of the last interval in `merged` to be the maximum of its current end time and the current interval's end time.  This effectively merges the two overlapping intervals.

3.  **Return:** Finally, we return the `merged` list containing the non-overlapping intervals.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) because of the sorting step. The rest of the algorithm is O(n).

**Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where no intervals overlap, and we store all the original intervals in the `merged` list. In other cases it will be less than O(n).
