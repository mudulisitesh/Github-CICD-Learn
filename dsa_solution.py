Okay, here's a problem description followed by a Python solution using dynamic programming:

**Problem:**

**Coin Change Problem (Number of Ways)**

You are given a set of coin denominations `coins` and a target amount `amount`. You have an unlimited supply of each coin denomination.  Write a function that determines the number of possible ways to make change for the given `amount` using the provided `coins`.

**Example:**

```
coins = [1, 2, 5]
amount = 5

Expected Output: 4  (Because: 5, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1)
```

**Python Solution (Dynamic Programming):**

```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    """
    Calculates the number of ways to make change for a given amount using a set of coins.

    Args:
        coins: A list of coin denominations.
        amount: The target amount.

    Returns:
        The number of possible ways to make change.
    """

    # dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to make change for amount j using the first i coins
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(amount + 1)] for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]

    # Base case: If the amount is 0, there's one way to make change (using no coins).
    for i in range(len(coins) + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 1

    # Iterate through the coins and amounts
    for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
        for j in range(1, amount + 1):
            # If the current coin denomination is less than or equal to the current amount
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                # The number of ways to make change is the sum of:
                # 1. The number of ways to make change without using the current coin (dp[i-1][j])
                # 2. The number of ways to make change by using the current coin (dp[i][j - coins[i-1]])
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - coins[i - 1]]
            else:
                # If the current coin is greater than the current amount, we cannot use it.
                # So, the number of ways is the same as using the previous coins.
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

    return dp[len(coins)][amount]

# Example Usage
coins = [1, 2, 5]
amount = 5
result = coin_change(coins, amount)
print(f"Number of ways to make change for {amount}: {result}") # Output: 4

coins = [2]
amount = 3
result = coin_change(coins, amount)
print(f"Number of ways to make change for {amount}: {result}") # Output: 0

coins = [1,2,3]
amount = 4
result = coin_change(coins, amount)
print(f"Number of ways to make change for {amount}: {result}") # Output: 4
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - `dp[i][j]` stores the number of ways to make change for amount `j` using the first `i` coins.

2. **Base Case:**
   - `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i`.  This means there's one way to make change for an amount of 0 (using no coins).

3. **Iteration:**
   - The code iterates through the coins and amounts.
   - For each coin `coins[i-1]` and amount `j`:
     - If `coins[i-1] <= j` (the coin's value is less than or equal to the amount), then the number of ways to make change is the sum of two possibilities:
       - `dp[i-1][j]`: The number of ways to make change without using the current coin.
       - `dp[i][j - coins[i-1]]`: The number of ways to make change by using at least one of the current coin.  We subtract the coin's value from the amount and look up the number of ways to make change for the remaining amount using the same set of coins (hence `dp[i]` instead of `dp[i-1]`).
     - If `coins[i-1] > j` (the coin's value is greater than the amount), then we cannot use the current coin.  The number of ways to make change is the same as using only the previous coins: `dp[i-1][j]`.

4. **Return Value:**
   - `dp[len(coins)][amount]` contains the final answer â€“ the number of ways to make change for the target amount using all the given coins.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n * amount), where `n` is the number of coins.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n * amount) due to the `dp` table.  (You could potentially optimize this to O(amount) by using only one row of the DP table, but it makes the code slightly less readable.)
